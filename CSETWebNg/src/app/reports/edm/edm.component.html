    <h1 style="text-align: center; color: #000; font-size: x-large; font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 10%;">External Dependencies Management for Assessment for <br/> Organization</h1>
    <h1 style="font-size: x-large; margin-bottom: 4%;">1. Introduction</h1>
    <p>
      Representatives of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) conducted an External Dependencies
      Management Assessment (EDM Assessment) at your organization. The EDM Assessment focuses on
      practices to manage risks associated with external dependencies, especially risks related to information
      and communications technology (ICT). This type of risk --also commonly called supply chain or third
      party risk --is of particular concern to many organizations, which increasingly have a large number of
      external dependencies. Organizations face inherent uncertainty in managing complex, rapidly
      changing, arms-length relationships involving technology. They also face a threat environment that
      exacerbates these concerns. The EDM Assessment helps by providing an efficient, effective way to
      measure and report on an organization's capability to manage this risk.
      <br/><br/>
      External dependencies exist when external entities have defined obligations or relationships with assets
      or services that your organization requires to support its business objectives and mission. Examples
      include third parties that provide, operate, control, have access to, own, or have other responsibilities
      over key ICT and related assets.
      <br/><br/>
      The Assessment is based on the principle that external dependencies require systematic management
      over their lifecycle. It poses a series of questions that provide insights into how an organization can
      improve its ability to manage dependency risks. Answers were gathered from key staff and
      subsequently scored according to a system similar to the Department of Homeland Security Cyber
      Resilience Review (CRR). The details are provided below.
    </p>
    <h1 style="font-size: x-large; margin-bottom: 4%;">2. Overview and Scope of the External Dependencies
      Management Assessment (EDM Assessment)</h1>
      <p>
        The EDM Assessment consists of a structured, facilitated interview of key personnel which takes a half
        day to complete. Its goal is to measure and report on the organization's cybersecurity practices as they
        relate to managing external dependencies and their associated risks. The assessment is derived from
        the Department of Homeland Security Cyber Resilience Review (CRR) and the external dependencies
        management process area of the Carnegie Mellon University CERT® Resilience Management Model
        (CERT-RMM). All of these resilience management resources use a common methodology. This
        provides an organized, actionable approach to managing cybersecurity risk based on a comprehensive
        array of industry standards and leading practices.
      </p>
      <div style="background-color: #d6e0f5; border: solid 1px black; padding: 1em; margin: 4% 0">
        External Dependencies Management establishes and manages an appropriate level of controls to
        ensure the resilience of services and assets that are dependent on the actions of external entities.
        (CERT Resilience Management Model, 2010)
      </div>
      <p>
        The EDM Assessment's approach is broad in that the organization is assessed against a range of
        external dependencies. Examples of dependencies include external entities that provide
      </p>
      <ol style="margin-bottom: 4%;">
        <li style="margin-bottom: 2%;">services that explicitly involve the operation, maintenance, or provisioning of ICT for the
          organization. Examples of these services include cloud services, data hosting, on-site
          maintenance services, and the operation of control systems to support the organization.</li>
        <li style="margin-bottom: 2%;">services supported by ICT, including any type of service that is appreciably supported through
          the use of information and communications technology. Examples vary by critical infrastructure
          sector. In the energy sector, they may involve upstream or downstream components that extract
          or transport energy. In the financial sector, examples may include the printing of account
          statements by the subcontractor to a banking institution.</li>
        <li style="margin-bottom: 2%;">governmental services, such as fire and police response to protect data centers. or</li>
        <li style="margin-bottom: 2%;">infrastructure services such as electricity, telecommunications networks, or transportation assets.</li>
        <li>technology products and services such as hardware and software that is utilized by the
          organization to provided services to its customers.</li>
      </ol>
      <h2 style="font-size: larger; margin-bottom: 2%;">2.1 Flexibility of the Approach</h2>
      <p>
        The EDM Assessment is designed to be a universal assessment method to evaluate the external
        dependency risk and resilience management capabilities of any critical infrastructure organization,
        regardless of the sector or the critical service the organization provides. It is intended to be useful
        regardless of whether the organization has well-defined resilience and risk management processes, is
        undertaking an effort to improve their resilience and risk management processes, or is just starting to
        examine the subject of external dependency risk. Ultimately, it is up to individual organizations to
        determine which EDM domains and practices are most relevant to their needs.
      </p>
      <h2 style="font-size: larger; margin-bottom: 2%;">2.2 Critical Service Scope</h2>
      <p>
        The EDM Assessment has a service orientation, meaning that it is intended to assess the
        organization's management of external dependencies relative to a specific critical service. A critical
        service is defined as:
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 1em 0 1em 4em;">
        A set of activities an organization carries out in the performance of a duty or in the
        production of a product that is so critical to the organization's success that its disruption
        would severely impact continued operations or success in meeting the organization's
        mission.
      </p>
      <p>
        Organizations typically have a set of critical services that define their mission. The selection of a critical
        service for assessment--rather than assessing the organization as a whole--helps to scope the
        assessment and tie the results to the organization's mission capabilities. For your organization the
        critical service assessed was:
      </p>
      <h1 style="font-size: x-large; margin-bottom: 4%;">3. Interpreting this Report</h1>
      <p>
        External dependencies involve acquiring and using ICT-related goods and services from external
        entities (third parties). Therefore, your organization is referred to as the “acquirer” in this report.
        <br/><br/>
        The report summarizes assessment findings and provides options for consideration in each category.
        These options outline general guidelines or activities that can be used to improve External
        Dependencies Management and the resilience of the critical service assessed. Sources include the
        CERT® Resilience Management Model (CERT-RMM), SEI-CMMI for Acquisition, National Institute of
        Standards and Technology (NIST) resources, the IT Infrastructure Library (ITIL), International
        Standards Organization (ISO) documents, and other cybersecurity standards. This material is not
        intended to fully represent all activities needed for a robust EDM program, but does provide initial
        guidance on how to incorporate various cybersecurity practices.
        <br/><br/>
        The guidance provided in this report includes NIST Special Publications and the NIST Cybersecurity
        Framework developed in conjunction with the private sector. These documents are extensively used by
        United States Federal civilian agencies; state, local, and tribal governments; and private sector
        organizations.
        <br/><br/>
        The EDM Assessment is an interview-based assessment. No documentary evidence or artifacts are
        examined or obtained during the assessment. Organizational performance is presented across several
        dimensions (e.g., contracts, third party oversight, controls, disruption management, and situational
        awareness) within the report. Scores are provided for individual Practices, Goals, and Domains.
        <br/><br/>
        While the EDM Assessment is derived in part from CERT RMM, the results do not constitute a formal
        appraisal against it. Detailed information about CERT-RMM can be found at <a href="www.cert.org/resilience">www.cert.org/resilience</a>.
        Options for Consideration appearing in italics have been derived from the Specific Goals (SG) and
        Specific Practices (SP) sections of CERT-RMM.
      </p>
      <h2 style="font-size: larger; margin-bottom: 2%;">3.1 EDM Assessment Structure</h2>
      <p>
        The EDM Assessment examines organizations for specific EDM practices and capabilities. They are
        organized into three domains that support the lifecycle of external relationships.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li style="margin-bottom: 2%;">Relationship Formation--activities that support the formation of relationships and dependencies
          on external entities. They include planning how the organization forms relationships, the
          selection and evaluation of suppliers and other entities, managing formal agreements, and
          incorporating EDM into the organization's risk management processes.</li>
        <li style="margin-bottom: 2%;">Relationship Management and Governance--ongoing management of external dependencies.
          Relationship management and governance includes a range of capabilities, such as ongoing
          risk management, supplier performance management, integrating external entities into internal
          processes such as change and capacity management, managing supplier transitions, and
          controlling the access of external entities to the organization.</li>
        <li style="margin-bottom: 2%;">Service Protection and Sustainment--incorporates dependence on external entities into the
          organization's processes to protect and sustain high-value services. These activities include
          situational awareness, service continuity, and incident management.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        The assessment also evaluates the organization's capability to sustain and refine these practices over
        time. These questions involve the planning, governance, measurement and standardization of EDM
        practices so that they are retained and effective during times of stress and disruption. Collectively, the
        organization's performance of basic practices and higher levels of practice to sustain an EDM capability
        comprise its maturity. This is described in Section 3.4.
      </p>
      <h2 style="font-size: larger; margin-bottom: 2%;">3.2 External Entity Types</h2>
      <p>
        Organizations typically rely on a range of different external entities to help them satisfy their mission
        and provide critical services. The organization's ability to manage these third parties may vary widely
        based on factors that include the degree of choice an organization has in selecting suppliers or other
        external entities; the organization's ability to drive behavior at the external entity; and the specific
        services provided.
        <br/><br/>
        To comprehensively measure the EDM capability of the organization and ensure completeness, several
        questions ask about practices performed with respect to different types of external entities. The external
        entity types used are
      </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 4em;">
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Supplier--</span>external entities that provide ICT-related goods and services and with which the
        acquirer has some ability to negotiate. These entities may also be called subcontractors or
        vendors. Depending on scoping and the needs of the organization, this category may also apply
        to supporting affiliates or separate business units of the larger enterprise. Examples of these
        suppliers include centrally managed IT or other business services. These relationships are
        sometimes governed by Operational Level Agreements.
      </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 4em;">
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Governmental services--</span>services provided by a governmental department or agency. These
        services frequently involve security; for example fire, police, and emergency response. Other
        examples include postal services and cybersecurity information providers like the DHS National
        Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center (NCCIC).
      </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 4em;">
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Infrastructure providers--</span>supplies goods or services to a region, economy, infrastructure
        sector, or political subdivision; however, the acquirer normally has no commercially practical
        ability to negotiate with this type of supplier. Examples of infrastructure providers include natural
        gas, water, power, or transportation.
        <br/><br/>
        These entity types are defined more fully in the glossary (79).
      </p>
      <h2 style="font-size: larger; margin-bottom: 2%;">3.3 Asset Types</h2>
      <p>
        A fundamental principle in the EDM Assessment is that organizations depend on a variety of ICT or
        cyber-related assets to provide critical services. External dependencies frequently exist when third
        parties have obligations or other relationships with respect to these assets. To support the accuracy
        and completeness of the assessment, several questions involve specific practices with respect to each
        category of assets. These asset categories are
      </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 4em;">
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">People--</span>for example, the staff that support data centers or otherwise use information and
        communications technology
      </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 4em;">
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Information--</span>for example, account information and personal health information
      </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 4em;">
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Technology--</span>for example, computers, software, and control systems
      </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 4em;">
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Facilities--</span>for example, offices or data centers.
      </p>
      <h2 style="font-size: larger; margin-bottom: 2%;">3.4 Maturity Indicator Levels</h2>
      <p>
        A Maturity Indicator Level (MIL) is assigned to the organization's External Dependencies Management
        capability. It represents a consolidated view of performance. The EDM maturity indicator level is
        automatically scored by the assessment tool and is displayed graphically for easy reference.
        <br/><br/>
        Maturity Indicator Levels describe attributes that are indicative of mature capabilities as represented in
        CERT-RMM. However, they are not a formal appraisal or certification of maturity, which are only
        assigned through a formal appraisal process that includes examination of documentation and other
        artifacts.

        The EDM Assessment uses one maturity scale for all three domains because the domains represent
        different parts of a lifecycle - from forming external relationships to managing incidents and
        consequences - rather than representing a fundamentally different capability. Ideally, higher level
        management should manage, measure, and oversee the organization's external dependencies
        management capability across this complete lifecycle.

      <h2 style="font-size: larger; margin-bottom: 2%;">3.5 Assessment Scoring Rules</h2>
      <span >This section describes the scoring rules that are used in the EDM Assessment.</span>
      <ol style="margin-top: 2%; margin-bottom: 2%;">
        <li style="margin-bottom: 2%;">Practices are either performed (answer =”Yes”), incompletely performed (answer =
          “Incomplete”), or not performed (answer = “No”).</li>
        <li style="margin-bottom: 2%;">A goal is achieved only if all practices are performed.</li>
        <li style="margin-bottom: 2%;">A Domain is achieved at MIL-1 if all the Goals in the Domain are achieved.</li>
        <li style="margin-bottom: 2%;">External Dependencies Management can be achieved at higher levels depending on the
          existence of practices at the higher MIL levels (MIL-2 through MIL-5).</li>
      </ol>
      <span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: large; margin-bottom: 2%; margin-top: 2%;">Scoring Rubric</span> <br/>
      <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Step 1</span> <br/>
      <span>Each Practice in a Domain is scored as follows.</span>
      <ul style="margin-bottom: 2%;">
        <li>performed when the question is answered with a “Yes” (green)</li>
        <li>incompletely performed when the question is answered with an “Incomplete” (yellow)</li>
        <li>not performed when a question is answered with a “No” (red)</li>
      </ul>
      <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Step 2</span> <br/>
      <span>Each Goal within the Domain is then scored as follows.</span>
      <ul style="margin-bottom: 2%;">
        <li>achieved when all practices are performed (green)</li>
        <li>partially achieved when some practices are performed (yellow)</li>
        <li>not achieved when no practices are performed (red)</li>
      </ul>
      <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Step 3</span> <br/>
      <span>External Dependencies Management is assigned a MIL level based on the following criteria.</span>
      <ul style="margin-bottom: 2%;">
        <li>MIL-0 if only some of the goals are achieved</li>
        <li>MIL-1 if all of the goals are achieved in each domain</li>
        <li>MIL-2 if MIL-1 is achieved and all of the MIL-2 questions are answered</li>
        <li>MIL-3 if MIL-2 is achieved and all of the MIL-3 questions are answered</li>
        <li>MIL-4 if MIL-3 is achieved and all of the MIL-4 questions are answered</li>
        <li>MIL-5 if MIL-4 is achieved and all of the MIL-5 questions are answered</li>

      Maturity Indicator Levels provide a combined measurement of the completeness of EDM practices, as well as the
      enterprise management activities necessary to ensure that this capability is sustained over time, despite
      disruptions or organizational changes. The MIL scale is cumulative; each MIL level must be complete before achieving a higher MIL is possible.
      Viewed collectively, these depictions provide an understanding of overall performance. While achieving a certain Maturity Indicator Level is
      one possible process improvement objective, it may not be the most important objective for every organization or in every context.

      The purpose of Relationship Formation is to assess whether the acquirer evaluates and controls the risks
      of relying on external entities before entering into relationships with them. Relationship Formation includes
      understanding the acquirer’s critical services, having a process for entering into formal relationships, and
      evaluating external entities. A key aspect of Relationship Formation is identifying resilience requirements
      as the basis for risk management and formal agreements. Resilience requirements typically focus on
      integrity, confidentiality, and availability, but can also include other requirements important to the critical
      service.

          A fundamental risk management principle is to focus on activities to protect and sustain services and
          assets that most directly affect the acquirer's ability to achieve its mission. This practice refers to
          identifying the assessed acquirer's high-value services, which it provides to its customers and other

          An acquirer must be able to identify its high-value assets, document them, and establish their value. This
          is done in order to develop strategies for protecting and sustaining assets commensurate with their value
          to services. The term high-value assets refers both to assets that are internal to the assessed acquirer
          and those that are owned, maintained, provided, etc. by external entities. <br /><br />

          Entities. <br /><br />
          For each external dependency, establish a list of resilience specifications that apply to the responsible
          external entity. The process for determining and documenting the resilience specifications that apply to
          an external dependency and entity will vary based on the action of the entity in relation to the acquirer's
          operations, the priority of the external dependency, and the management structure within the acquirer. At
          a minimum, the resilience specifications should include a clear and definitive statement of the external
          entity's services, support, products, assets, or staff on which the acquirer relies.
          Requirements should be gathered and documented for each type of external dependency. Even in cases
          where it is not practical to include these requirements in formal agreements with external entities, they
          are useful as a way to assess and manage risks against external dependencies. <br /><br />

          From a resilience perspective, the selection process for external entities is often an extension of or
          supplement to the organization's standard procurement processes. Resilience specifications may simply
          serve as additional requirements for consideration and evaluation as part of the standard procurement
          process. In all cases, due diligence should be performed on candidate external entities to evaluate their
          ability to meet the resilience specifications that have been established for the actions they hope to
          perform for the organization. <br /><br />
          In some cases, external entities cannot be selected from a pool of candidates; they may be inherited in
          the course of an acquisition or merger or they may be the only provider of a high-value service on which
          the organization depends (this is often the case for public services). In cases in which external entities
          cannot be selected, the due diligence process for selection should still be performed to identify any
          specifications that are not met by the external entity. It may be appropriate to alter the specifications by
          changing the actions or nature of the dependence on the external entity to resolve the unmet specifications.
          In cases where the specifications cannot be changed, any unmet specifications should be treated as risks.

          Because of the pervasive nature of operational risk, a comprehensive operational risk management
          strategy is needed to ensure proper consideration of risk and the effects on operational resilience. The
          strategy provides a common foundation for the performance of operational risk management activities
          (which are typically dispersed throughout the organization) and for the collection, coordination, and
          elevation of operational risk to the organization's enterprise risk management process. <br /><br />
          Preparation for operational risk management requires the organization to develop and maintain a
          strategy for identifying, analyzing, and mitigating operational risks. This strategy is documented in a risk
          management plan and addresses the activities that the organization performs enterprise-wide to carry
          out a continuous risk management program. This includes identifying the sources and types of
          operational risk and establishing a strategy that details the organization's approach, activities, and
          objectives for managing these risks as a fundamental operational resilience management process. <br /><br />

          <span style="font-style: italic;">Managing risk is a complex, multifaceted activity that requires the
            involvement of the entire organization</span>-
          from senior leaders/executives providing the strategic vision and top-level goals and objectives for the
          organization; to mid-level leaders planning, executing, and managing projects; to individuals on the front
          lines operating the information systems supporting the organization's missions/business functions. Risk
          management is a comprehensive process that requires organizations to: (i) frame risk (i.e., establish the
          context for risk-based decisions); (ii) assess risk; (iii) respond to risk once determined; and (iv) monitor
          risk on an ongoing basis using effective organizational communications and a feedback loop for
          continuous improvement in the risk-related activities of organizations. Risk management is carried out as
          a holistic, organization-wide activity that addresses risk from the strategic level to the tactical level,
          ensuring that risk- based decision making is integrated into every aspect of the organization. <br /><br />

          <br /><br />
          Identification of risks due to external dependencies requires an understanding of the actions of the
          associated external entity in the operation, support, or resilience of the organization's services. External
          entities will be responsible for varying dependencies in the support of the organization's operations.

          <span style="font-weight: bold;">[RISK:SG1:SP1]</span> Determine Risk Sources and Categories. <br /><br />
          The sources of risk to assets and services are identified and the categories of risk that are relevant to
          the organization are determined. <br /><br />
          Identifying risk sources helps the organization to determine and categorize the types of operational risk
          that are most likely to affect day-to-day operations and to seed an organization-specific risk taxonomy
          that can be used as a tool for managing risk on a continuous basis as operating conditions change and
          evolve. The sources of risk can be both internal and external to the organization. <br /><br />
          Categorizing operational risks provides the organization a means from which to perform advanced
          analysis and mitigation activities that allow for similar types of risks to be effectively neutralized or
          contained by limited actions by the organization. <br /><br />

          System integrators are those entities that provide customized services to the acquirer including custom
          development, test, operations, and maintenance. This group usually replies to a request for proposal
          from an acquirer with a proposal that describes solution or services that are customized to the acquirer's
          requirements. Such proposals provided by system integrators can include many layers of suppliers (see
          Chapter 3.3.2). <span style="font-style: italic;"> The system integrator should ensure that those suppliers
            are vetted and verified with
            respect to the acquirer's ICT SCRM requirements. </span> Because of the level of visibility that can be
          obtained
          in the relationship with the system integrator, the acquirer has the ability to require rigorous supplier
          acceptance criteria as well as any relevant countermeasures to address identified or potential risks.
          <br /><br />
          Organizations should consider that the costs of doing business with suppliers may be directly impacted
          by the level of <span style="font-style: italic;">visibility the suppliers allow into how they apply security
            and supply chain practices</span> to
          their solutions. When organizations or system integrators require greater levels of transparency from
          suppliers, they must consider the possible cost implications of such requirements. Suppliers may select
          to not participate in procurements to avoid increased costs or perceived risks to their intellectual
          property, limiting an organization's supply or technology choices. The risk to suppliers is the potential for

          Agreements are often composed from multiple sections or multiple documents, each of which describes
          some aspect of the arrangement and agreement. In all cases, the agreement, regardless of form, should:
          <ul>
            <li>be enforceable by the organization</li>
            <li><span style="font-style: italic;">include detailed and complete specifications that must be met by the
                external entity (see EXD:SG3.SP1 and EXD:SG3.SP2)</span></li>
            <li><span style="font-style: italic;">include any required performance standards or work products from the
                organization</span></li>
            <li>be changed to reflect changes in specifications over the life of the relationship</li>
          </ul>
          Subpractices:
          <ol>
            <li>Select an agreement type that best fits the performance standards required by the organization and that
              is enforceable if problems arise.</li>
            <li>Properly document the agreement terms, conditions, specifications and other provisions.</li>
          </ol>
          All agreement provisions should be documented in the agreement in language that is unambiguous. <br /><br />
          The agreement <span style="font-style: italic;">should not contain any general exceptions for achieving the
            resilience specifications
            unless they are carefully considered and negotiated.</span> It may, however, contain scenarios of types of
          unforeseen events for which the external entity is not expected to prepare. Any exceptions granted to
          resilience specifications or scenarios for which the external entity is not required to prepare should be
          treated as risks under EXD:SG2. <br /><br />
          All agreements should <span style="font-style: italic;">establish and enable procedures for monitoring the
            performance of external
            entities</span> and inspecting the services or products they deliver to the organization. <br /><br />

          It is important for the organization to identify and characterize external dependencies so that they can be
          understood, formalized, monitored, and managed as part of the organization's comprehensive risk
          management process. <br /><br />
          The organization's list of services should be examined to discover services that may be subject to
          external dependencies, in whole or in part. The organization's inventory of assets should also be
          examined to discover assets that are under the control of external entities or are in other ways subject to
          external dependencies. The organization may find value and efficiency in establishing close service links
          or overlap to facilitate information sharing between the external dependencies list, the services listing,
          and the asset inventory. The organization's customer database and supplier database may also be
          valuable sources of insight when establishing the catalog of external dependencies. The organization's
          set of current supplier and vendor contracts and related service level agreements (SLAs) are additional
          sources. <br /><br />

    <p>
      The maturity indicator level questions below apply to all of the domains in this assessment; Relationship
      Formation, Relationship Management and Governance, and Service Protection and Sustainment.
      Achievement of the maturity indicator levels means that external dependencies management is more likely
      to be effective, consistent, and retained during times of disruption or organizational change. One maturity
      scale is used because the three domains represent one continuous lifecycle.

          Consider developing a plan for performing External Dependencies Management. A plan is developed 
          to ensure that the acquirer and its staff know how external dependencies will be managed across the 
          entire lifecycle of relationships. External dependencies exist when external entities have defined obligations 
          or relationships with assets or services that the acquirer depends on to support the critical service. Examples 
          include external entities that provide, operate, control, have access to, own, or have other responsibilities with 
          respect to key assets. <br/> <br/>
          The plan should address the resilience specifications for the critical service or the product being provided. The EDM plan 
          should detail how core goals relating to EDM will be performed - for example evaluating suppliers, entering into formal agreements, 
          monitoring changes at external entities, and prioritizing dependencies. The EDM plan will normally also detail the other resilience 
          and security domains that are relevant to EDM at the acquirer. These may include, for example, risk management, incident management, 
          service continuity, or change management. This is important so that the resilience processes across the acquirer will adequately 
          support EDM according to consistent requirements and priorities. <br/><br/>
          In practice, many of the required actions to manage external dependencies may be documented in other plans or documents (for example vendor selection and contracting procedures).
          The purpose of an EDM plan is not to duplicate or repeat material in other plans or documentation, but rather to clarify and harmonize the roles and responsibilities of staff and 
          processes across the acquirer. For example, the acquirer's service continuity plan may include actions involving suppliers in the event of a natural disaster. <br><br/>
          The EDM plan, on the other hand, may detail roles, responsibilities, and processes to ensure that continuity plans are updated based on relevant changes, for example contractual 
          changes that may affect service continuity. The plan may detail how different functions or departments will coordinate their efforts to support EDM. <br/><br/> 
          Plans should explain:
          <ul>
            <li>who performs EDM practices</li>
            <li>key stakeholders</li>
            <li>when and how often they are performed, and</li>
            <li>the key processes involved in EDM</li>
          </ul>
          Typical items addressed in an EDM plan may include:
          <ul>
            <li>identifying and prioritizing external dependencies</li>
            <li>associating external dependencies with services and assets</li>
            <li>managing operational risks resulting from external dependencies</li>
            <li>evaluating and selecting external entities</li>
            <li>formalizing and enforcing agreements with external entities, including changing provisions</li>
            <li>terminations of relationships with external entities</li>
            <li>integrating external dependencies into incident management and service continuity planning and exercising</li>
          </ul> <br/>
          Sub practices:
          <ul>
            <li>Document the plan</li>
            <li>Document the process description</li>
            <li>Review the plan with relevant stakeholders and obtain their agreement</li>
            <li>Revise the plan as necessary</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">CERT-RMM Reference</span> <br />
          Consider developing policies for external dependencies management. Policy consists of high level statements 
          by organizational leadership concerning external dependencies management. The purpose of policy is to 
          establish and maintain governance over the planning and performance of external dependencies management. 
          Policy will typically address:
          <ul>
            <li>responsibility, authority, and ownership for performing activities</li>
            <li>the importance of external dependencies management</li>
            <li>the acquirer's approach to its critical services and their prioritization</li>
            <li>methods for measuring adherence to policy, granting exceptions, and identifying policy violations</li>
            <li>consequences for noncompliance with policy</li>
            <li>the acquirer's approach to selecting suppliers and external entities</li>
            <li>the acquirer's approach to risk management as it pertains to external dependencies</li>
            <li>enterprise requirements or policies to which external entities are expected to adhere</li>
            <li>monitoring the performance of external entities</li>
            <li>issue escalation and dispute resolution</li>
            <li>applying corrective action to relationships with external entities as specified in formal agreements</li>
            <li>terminating relationships with external entities as specified in formal agreements</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">CERT-RMM Reference</span> <br />
          Consider including process descriptions for EDM in policy or plan documents. Process descriptions document 
          the series of actions or specific steps that are necessary to perform external dependencies management activities 
          in a repeatable, predictable manner. <br/>
          Examples may include:
          <ul>
            <li>the process to form supplier relationships, for example the steps ("gates") and approval authorities required for new relationships</li>
            <li>the actions required to purchase or invest in new technology</li>
            <li>processes to ensure the external entity concerns are included in risk management. For example, 
              these may include a process to ensure that supplier performance problems are entered into risk 
              registers or other risk monitoring tools.</li>
            <li>the process to identify external dependencies, for example processes involving checking internal 
              financial statements to identify supplier relationships outside the formal relationship management program.</li>
            <li>the process to make changes to plans that involve external dependencies management, for example the service continuity, risk management, or incident management plans.</li>
            <li>the process to make sure that requirements for infrastructure providers and governmental services are managed. For example, these processes may focus on advising the
               corporate staff who interface with infrastructure and governmental authorities about changes and threats to the critical service.</li>
            <li>the process to transition supplier relationships including, for example, the input of technical staff or critical service business owners at the acquirer.</li>
            <li>the process to manage external entity access to the acquirer, for example the process to remove access when contractor staff are terminated or change staff positions</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">CERT-RMM Reference</span> <br />
          Consider identifying stakeholders of the EDM process and engaging them to ensure they are aware of their roles. Examples include:
          <ul>
            <li>internal and external owners and custodians of organizational assets</li>
            <li>internal and external service owners</li>
            <li>organizational unit and line of business managers responsible for high-value assets and the services the support</li>
            <li>staff responsible for managing operational risk</li>
            <li>staff responsible for establishing, implementing, and maintaining an internal control system for organizational assets</li>
            <li>staff required to develop, test, implement, and execute service continuity plans that involve external dependencies</li>
            <li>acquisition and procurement staff</li>
            <li>internal and external auditors</li>
          </ul> <br/>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">CERT-RMM Reference</span> <br />
          Consider developing standards and guidelines for external dependencies management. Examples include:
          <ul>
            <li>criteria for prioritizing external dependencies</li>
            <li>templates that define the information required to identify, track and manage external dependencies in databases or information repositories</li>
            <li>the guidelines and standards required to make risk statements and impact valuations</li>
            <li>agreement templates, including enterprise specifications that apply to external entities</li>
            <li>standard RFPs, including applicable requirements</li>
            <li>criteria for selecting external entities</li>
            <li>performance-monitoring report standards and templates</li>
            <li>inspection reports on deliverables</li>
            <li>corrective-action report standards and examples</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
