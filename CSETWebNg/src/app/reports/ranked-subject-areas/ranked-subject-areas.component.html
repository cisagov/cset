    Ranked Subject Areas
</h1>

<p>
    This chart shows subject areas needing the most attention.  Each bar represents the labeled subject area’s
    weighted contribution
    so that the combined total always equals 100%.  The weighted contribution includes the importance of both
    the
    question and the subject area, as well as the percentage of missed questions in that subject area.
