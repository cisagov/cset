<h1>Executive Summary</h1>
<p>
    The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) developed the Hydropower Cybersecurity Value-at-Risk Framework (CVF)
    and web application. The web-based tool assists the facility’s energy management team by walking the user through an
    assessment framework and bringing guidance and structure to the extensive array of cybersecurity controls applicable
    to hydropower plant resources. The assessment covers several domains containing multiple layers that address key
    cybersecurity topics and create a robust and ﬂexible framework speciﬁcally designed for the hydropower fleet.
