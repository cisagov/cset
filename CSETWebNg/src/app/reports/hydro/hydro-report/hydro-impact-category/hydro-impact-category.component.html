                Impact category is the classification of where a particular impact
                may happen if a cyber attack were to occur. The breakdown of the
                chart is by domain, with different categories that we have defined
                as most applicable to this assessment: Economic, Environmental,
                Operational, and Safety. {{facilityName}} can see the breakdown of how
                the answers of the assessment relate to what potential impacts the
                facility may have in case of a cyberattack.
