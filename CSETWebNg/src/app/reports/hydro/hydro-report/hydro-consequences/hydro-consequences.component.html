            Consequences are the effects of having a control not implemented
            or partially implemented. There are five consequences that are
            attributed to each of the controls: Denial-of-service,
            Natural disaster/Physical Attack, Integrity based attack,
            Data-breach, and Ransomware. The chart to the right shows the
            breakdown of {{facilityName}}’s consequence likelihood breakdown based on answers in the assessment.
