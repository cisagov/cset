                Feasibility is defined as how much resources will it take
                to implement a particular control. It is broken down into
                three different tiers: Easy, Medium, and Hard. Easy means
                that the control will require no existing process, and cost
                little to no money to implement. Medium means that a control
                will require multiple inputs from multiple personnel and may
                cost a significant amount. High means that a control will require
                a significant lift requiring multiple inputs from personnel
                and require a significant cost. {{facilityName}} can see how their
                facility breaks down in terms of how difficult controls will be to implement.
