            During the assessment process, personnel conducting the assessment along with facility stakeholders
            identified potential vulnerabilities along with suggested options for consideration. The process and listed
            options for consideration provide an opportunity for the facility owners/operators (stakeholders) to
            mitigate vulnerabilities, increase resilience, and implement protective measures. This process involves an
            assessment of risk tailored to the facility that takes into consideration the threat, assets to be
            protected, facility characteristics and capital expenditures planning. The options for consideration are not
            prescriptive endorsements of specific protective measures to be installed and/or used at the facility. The
            critical infrastructure owner or operator determines for the facility whether the options for consideration
            provide the desired enhancements in light of the facility’s current security and resilience posture,
            anticipated growth or organizational changes, budgetary outlook, etc. No assessment process or respective
            options for consideration have the ability to provide solutions which fully eliminate the possibility of
            undesirable events or associated outcomes.
