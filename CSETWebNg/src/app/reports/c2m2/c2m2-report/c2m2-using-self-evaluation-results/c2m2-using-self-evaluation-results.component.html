  <h1>5. Using the Self-Evaluation Results</h1>
  <p>
    The C2M2 is meant to be used by an organization to evaluate its cybersecurity capabilities
    consistently, to communicate its capability levels in meaningful terms, and to inform the
    prioritization of its cybersecurity investments. Figure 4 summarizes a potential approach for using
    the model. An organization performs a self-evaluation against the model, uses that self-evaluation
    to identify gaps in capability, prioritizes those gaps and develops plans to address them, and finally
    implements plans to address the gaps. As plans are implemented, business objectives change, and
    the risk environment evolves, the process is repeated. This section offers a brief overview of how
    to use the self-evaluation results in this approach. For a more detailed review of these steps and
    additional guidance, see the "Using the Model" section of the C2M2 V2.1 model document
    available here: <a href="https://energy.gov/C2M2" target="_blank">https://energy.gov/C2M2</a>.

    Figure 4: Proposed Approach for Using the Model
  </span>

  <p>
    This report summarizes the results of the organization’s self-evaluation conducted in Step 1, Perform a
    Self-Evaluation.
  </p>
  <p>
    It provides a point-in-time view of the cybersecurity posture of the in-scope function. Self-evaluation workshop
    participants should review this report and collectively address, and any discrepancies or questions before the next
    step.
  </p>
  <p>
    In Step 2, Analyze Identified Gaps, the organization identifies gaps in the performance of model
    practices by examining the self-evaluation results against its target profile — the desired profile
    that represents the organization’s target MIL rating for each domain in the model. Organizations
    using the model for the first time may identify the target profile after performing a self-evaluation,
    while others often identify a target profile before conducting a self-evaluation. For more
    information on setting targets, see Appendix D, "Setting Targets" in the C2M2 Self-Evaluation Guide
    available here: <a href="https://energy.gov/C2M2" target="_blank">https://energy.gov/C2M2</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    In Step 3, Prioritize and Plan, the organization uses the gap analysis to prioritize the actions needed to fully
    implement the practices in the target profile. A cost-benefit analysis may help to inform the prioritization of
    actions
    needed. The organization should then develop a plan to address the selected gaps and assign ownership of the plan to
    an
    individual with sufficient authority to oversee implementation.
  </p>
  <p>
    Regular reviews by organizational leadership should be conducted to evaluate status, clear obstacles, and identify
    any
    necessary course corrections as implementation progresses.
  </p>
  <p>
    In Step 4, Implement Plans and Periodically Reevaluate, plans developed in the previous step should be implemented
    to
    address the identified gaps. Subsequent model self-evaluations are particularly useful in tracking implementation
    and
    should be conducted periodically to ensure that desired progress is achieved. Reevaluations should also be
    considered in
    response to major changes in business, technology, market, or threat environments to ensure that the current profile
    matches the organization’s desired state.
