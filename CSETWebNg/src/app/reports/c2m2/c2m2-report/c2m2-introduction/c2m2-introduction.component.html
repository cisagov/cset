  <h1>1. Introduction</h1>
  <p>
    The Cybersecurity Capability Maturity Model (C2M2) can help organizations of all sectors, types, and sizes to
    evaluate
    and make improvements to their cybersecurity programs and strengthen their operational resilience. This report
    presents
    the results of a C2M2 self-evaluation. The results included in this report may be used to measure and improve an
    existing cybersecurity program. It also may serve as an input for other activities, such as informing cybersecurity
    risk
    managers about the controls in place to mitigate cybersecurity risks within an organization.
  </p>
  <p>
    The results presented in this report are based on participant responses describing the degree to which C2M2
    practices
    are implemented. This report may include sensitive information and should be protected accordingly.
