    <p>
        This report is provided "as-is" for informational purposes only. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security
        Agency
        (CISA) does not provide any warranties of any kind regarding any information
        contained within. In no event shall the United States Government or its contractors or
        subcontractors be liable for any damages, including but not limited to, direct, indirect,
        special or consequential damages and including damages based on any negligence
        of the United States Government or its contractors or subcontractors, arising out of, resulting
        from, or in any way connected with this report, whether or not based upon warranty,
        contract, tort, or otherwise, whether or not injury was sustained from, or arose out of the
        results of, or reliance upon the report.
    </p>
    <p>
        The CISA does not endorse any commercial product or service, including the subject of the
        analysis in this report. Any reference to specific commercial products, processes, or services
        by service mark, trademark, manufacturer, or otherwise, does not constitute or imply their
        endorsement, recommendation, or favoring by CISA.
    </p>
    <p>
        The display of the CISA official seal or other CISA visual identities on this report shall not be
        interpreted to provide the recipient organization authorization to use the official seal, insignia
        or other visual identities of the Department of Homeland Security. The CISA seal, insignia,
        or other visual identities shall not be used in any manner to imply endorsement of any
        commercial product or activity by CISA or the United States Government. Use of the CISA
        seal without proper authorization violates federal law (e.g., 18 U.S.C. §§ 506, 701, 1017), and
        is against CISA policies governing usage of its seal.
