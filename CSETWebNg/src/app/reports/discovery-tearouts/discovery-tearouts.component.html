            The analysis, data, and reports in CSET® are provided “as is” for informational purposes only. The

            including
            but not limited to, direct, indirect, special, or consequential damages and including damages based on any
            negligence
            of the United States Government or its contractors or subcontractors, arising out of, resulting from, or in
            any
            way connected with this report, whether based on warranty, contract, tort, or otherwise, whether injury was
            sustained
            from, or arose out of the results of, or reliance upon the report.
        </p>

        <p>
            DHS does not endorse any commercial product or service, including the subject of the assessment or
            evaluation in this report.
            Any reference to specific commercial products, processes, or services by trademark, manufacturer, or
            otherwise,
            does not constitute or imply its endorsement, recommendation, or favoring by DHS.

        <p>
            The display of the DHS official seal or other DHS visual identities on this report shall not be interpreted
            to provide the
            recipient organization authorization to use the official seal, insignia, or other visual identities of DHS.
            The
            DHS seal, insignia, or other visual identities shall not be used in any manner to imply endorsement of any
            commercial
            product or activity by DHS or the United States Government. Use of the DHS seal without proper authorization
            violates federal law (e.g., 18 U.S.C. §§ 506, 701, 1017), and is against DHS policies governing usage of the
            seal.

        <h1>Advisory</h1>

        <p>
            CSET® is only one component of the overall cyber security picture and should be complemented with a robust
            cyber security
            program within the organization. A self-assessment with CSET® cannot reveal all types of security
            weaknesses,
            and should not be the sole means of determining an organization’s security posture.
        </p>

        <p>
            The tool will not provide a detailed architectural analysis of the network or a detailed network
            hardware/software configuration
            review. It is not a risk analysis tool so it will not generate a complex risk assessment. CSET® is not
            intended
            as a substitute for in depth analysis of control system vulnerabilities as performed by trained
            professionals.
            Periodic onsite reviews and inspections must still be conducted using a holistic approach including facility
            walk downs, interviews, and observation and examination of facility practices. Consideration should also be
            given
            to additional steps including scanning, penetration testing, and exercises on surrogate, training, or
            non-production
            systems, or systems where failures, unexpected faults, or other unexpected results will not compromise
            production
            or safety.
        </p>

        <p>
            CSET® assessments cannot be completed effectively by any one individual. A cross-functional team consisting
            of representatives
            from operational, maintenance, information technology, business, and security areas is essential. The
            representatives
            must be subject matter experts with significant expertise in their respective areas. No one individual has
            the
            span of responsibility or knowledge to effectively answer all the questions.
        </p>

        <p>
            Data and reports generated by the tool should be managed securely and marked, stored, and distributed in a
            manner appropriate
            to their sensitivity.
