        <h1>Advisory</h1>
        <p>
            CSET® is only one component of the overall cybersecurity picture and should be complemented with a robust
            cybersecurity program within the organization. A self-assessment with CSET® cannot reveal all types of
            security
            weaknesses, and should not be the sole means of determining an organization’s security posture.
        </p>

        <p>
            The tool will not provide a detailed architectural analysis of the network or a detailed network
            hardware/software configuration review. It is not a risk analysis tool so it will not generate a complex
            risk assessment. CSET® is not
            intended as a substitute for in depth analysis of control system vulnerabilities as performed by trained
            professionals. Periodic onsite reviews and inspections must still be conducted using a holistic approach
            including facility walk downs, interviews, and observation and examination of facility practices.
            Consideration should also be
            given to additional steps including scanning, penetration testing, and exercises on surrogate, training, or
            non-production systems, or systems where failures, unexpected faults, or other unexpected results will not
            compromise
            production or safety.
        </p>

        <p>
            CSET® assessments cannot be completed effectively by any one individual. A cross-functional team consisting
            of representatives
            from operational, maintenance, information technology, business, and security areas is essential. The
            representatives
            must be subject matter experts with significant expertise in their respective areas. No one individual has
            the
            span of responsibility or knowledge to effectively answer all the questions.
        </p>

        <p>
            Data and reports generated by the tool should be managed securely and marked, stored, and distributed in a
            manner appropriate
            to their sensitivity.

    <div class="levelDescriptions">
        <h1>CMMC Level 1 {{cmmcStyleSvc?.cmmcModel?.TargetLevel == 1 ? ' - TARGET LEVEL' : ''}}</h1>
        <p class="levelTitle">PROCESSES: Performed</p>
        <p>Level 1 requires that an organization performs the specified practices. Because the
            organization may only be able to perform these practices in an ad-hoc manner and may
            or may not rely on documentation, process maturity is not assessed for Level 1.</p>
        <p class="levelTitle">PRACTICES: Basic Cyber Hygiene</p>
        <p>Level 1 focuses on the protection of FCI and consists only of practices that correspond to the
            basic safeguarding requirements specified in 48 CFR 52.204-21 ("Basic Safeguarding of Covered
            Contractor Information Systems")[3].</p>

        <h1>CMMC Level 2 {{cmmcStyleSvc?.cmmcModel?.TargetLevel == 2 ? ' - TARGET LEVEL' : ''}}</h1>
        <p class="levelTitle">PROCESSES: Documented</p>
        <p>Level 2 requires that an organization establish and document practices and
            policies to guide the implementation of their CMMC efforts. The documentation of
            practices enables individuals to perform them in a repeatable manner. Organizations
            develop mature capabilities by documenting their processes and then practicing them
            as documented.</p>
        <p class="levelTitle">PRACTICES: Intermediate Cyber Hygiene</p>
        <p>Level 2 serves as a progression from Level 1 to Level 3 and consists of a subset of the
            security requirements specified in NIST SP 800-171 [4] as well as practices from other
            standards and references. Because this level represents a transitional stage, a subset of the
            practices reference the protection of CUI.</p>

        <h1>CMMC Level 3 {{cmmcStyleSvc?.cmmcModel?.TargetLevel == 3 ? ' - TARGET LEVEL' : ''}}</h1>
        <p class="levelTitle">PROCESSES: Managed</p>
        <p>Level 3 requires that an organization establish, maintain. and resource a plan demonstrating the
            management of activities for practice implementation.
            The plan may include information on mission goals,
            project plans, resourcing, required training, and involvement of relevant stakeholders.
        </p>
        <p class="levelTitle">PRACTICES: Good Cyber Hygiene</p>
        <p>Level 3 focuses on the protection of CUI and encompasses all of the security requirements
            specified in NIST SP 800-171 [4] as well as additional practices from other standards
            and references to mitigate threats.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is noted that DFARS clause 252.204-7012 ("Safeguarding of Covered Defense Information and Cyber Incident
            Reporting")
            [5] specifies additional requirements beyond the NIST SP 800-171 security such as incident reporting.

        <p>
            The theft of intellectual property and sensitive information from all industrial sectors due to
            malicious cyber activity threatens economic security and national security. The Council of
            Economic Advisors estimates that malicious cyber activity cost the U.S. economy between
            $57 billion and $109 billion in 2016. The Center for Strategic and International Studies
            estimates that the total global cost of cybercrime was as high as $600 billion in 2017.
        </p>
        <p>
            Malicious cyber actors have targeted, and continue to target the Defense Industrial Base
            (DIB) sector and the supply chain of the Department of Defense (DoD). The DIB sector
            consists of over 300,000 companies that support the warfighter and contribute towards the
            research, engineering, development, acquisition, production, delivery, sustainment, and
            operations of DoD systems, networks, installations, capabilities, and services. The aggregate
            loss of intellectual property and certain unclassified information from the DoD supply chain
            can undercut U.S. technical advantages and innovation as well as significantly increase risk to
            national security.
        </p>
        <p>
            Standards, guides, and maturity models have been developed, vetted, and widely accepted
            to assist with protection from cyber attacks. The Cyber Security Evaluation Tool (CSET)
            includes a selectable array of these materials for a tailored assessment of cyber
            vulnerabilities. Once the level is selected and the resulting requirements tested,
            CSET creates a compliance summary, compiled variance statistics, ranked top areas
            of concern, and generated security and maturity model recommendations.
        </p>
        <p>
            This report illustrates the cybersecurity maturity posture across the organization.
            Conclusions and graphical representations drawn from the assessment encompass multiple
            maturity levels ranging from "Basic Cybersecurity Hygiene" to "Advanced/Progressive," also
            expressed as "Performed" to "Optimized" in Figure 3.
        </p>
        <p>
            The figure shows the organization’s progress throughout the CMMC based on the
            individual target level and overall cybersecurity assessment.
