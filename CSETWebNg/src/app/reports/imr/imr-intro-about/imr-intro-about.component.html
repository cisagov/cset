<h4>
    Introduction
</h4>
<p>
    On {{ model?.assessmentDetails?.assessment_Date | localizeDate }}, {{
    model?.assessmentDetails?.facility_Name
    ?? '[Facility Name]' }} conducted an Incident Management Review (IMR).
    Answers to questions regarding the implementation of
    incident handling and response practices within the organization were gathered. The results are reported here.
</p>

<br />

<h4>Overview and Scope of the IMR</h4>
<p>
    The IMR is based on the principle that a resilient incident management function can improve an
    organization's overall cyber resilience. The IMR consists of a series of questions, the answers to which
    provide insights into how an organization can improve its ability to identify, analyze, and respond to incidents
    in a repeatable manner.
</p>

<p>
    An “Incident Management Function” is that part(s) of the organization that provides incident handling and
    response services for the organization. It is responsible for the performance of all incident handling and
    response practices. In this report, for the sake of simplicity, the term “incident management personnel” refers
    to the groups or individuals who perform the Incident Management Function activities. Further, the term
    “organization” refers to the entire [sovereign] group, including the incident management personnel. We use
    the term “stakeholders” to identify those with a vested interest in the organization's Incident Management
    Function or in its activities, whether internal or external to the organization.
</p>

<p>
    The IMR consists of a structured, facilitated interview of key personnel, and takes approximately a half-day
    to complete. The IMR helps an organization understand and qualitatively measure its incident handling and
    response capability and the cybersecurity practices that support it. Key personnel are asked to describe
    how selected practices for both incident handling and response and cybersecurity are performed and
    managed. Participants are asked to articulate evidence regarding the performance of these
    practices. The IMR examines Incident Management practices grouped in the following categories.
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Event Detection and Handling</li>
    <li>Incident Declaration, Handling and Response</li>
    <li>Post-Incident Analysis and Testing</li>
    <li>Integrate Organizational Capabilities</li>
    <li>Protect and Sustain the Incident Management Function</li>
    <li>Prepare for Incident Response</li>
</ol>

<p>
    The practices examined during an IMR are derived from a set of metrics developed in 2002 by the Defense
    Information Systems Agency (DISA) and National Security Agency (NSA) and called the DoD Computer
    Network Defense Service Provider (CNDSP) <em>Evaluator Scoring Metrics (ESM)</em>. In 2003, the Department of
    Homeland Security (DHS) and United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT) funded
    initial work for the CERT Division at Carnegie Mellon University's Software Engineering Institute to adapt that
    set of metrics for Federal use into a document called the <em>Federal Incident Response Evaluation (FIRE)
        Capabilities</em>. Additional practices come from the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, NIST SP 800-61 <em>Computer
        Security Incident Handling Guide</em>, the Cyber Resilience Review (CRR) and from a larger security and
    business continuity framework known as the CERT Resilience Management Model (CERT-RMM).

<h4>About this Report</h4>
<p>
    The answers gathered from your key staff have been collected and
    evaluated, and are presented in this report.
</p>

<p>
    The report summarizes the assessment findings, and provides your organization with options for
    consideration for each practice. The options for consideration provide general guidelines or
    activities intended to help your organization improve its incident handling and response capabilities.
    These options are not meant to fully represent all activities needed for a robust incident
    management program but, rather, to provide initial guidance on how to incorporate various incident
    handling and response practices, including National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST),
    CERT Resilience Management Model (CERT-RMM), and other standards. Detailed information
    about CERT-RMM can be found at <a href="https://www.cert.org/resilience"
        target="_blank">www.cert.org/resilience</a>. The
    options for consideration provided
    include guidance from NIST Special Publications. The primary audience for these documents is
    United States Federal Civilian Agencies, however NIST encourages the adoption of these
    guidelines by State, local, and tribal governments, as well as private sector organizations.
    Guidance from the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF) for Improving Critical Infrastructure
    Cybersecurity is also included. The Framework, created through collaboration between industry
    and government, consists of standards, guidelines, and practices to promote the protection of
    critical infrastructure.

<h4>Incident Management Review Results</h4>
<p>
    The IMR is an interview-based assessment. It is understood that participants often do not have
    complete knowledge of an organization's operations. Actual performance may vary from what is
    indicated in this report. Organizational performance is presented across several dimensions within
    the report. Scores are provided for individual Practices, Goals, and Domains.
</p>
<br />

<h4>Basic Rules</h4>
<ol>
    <li>
        Practices are either performed (answer =”Yes”), incompletely performed (answer =
        “Incomplete”), or not performed (answer = “No”)
    </li>
</ol>
