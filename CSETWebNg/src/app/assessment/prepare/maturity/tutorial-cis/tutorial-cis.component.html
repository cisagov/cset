        <h4>Overview</h4>
        <p>The CIS goal is to assess the foundational and essential cybersecurity practices of an organization's critical
            service to identify dependencies, capabilities and emerging effects of the current cybersecurity posture. CIS
            focuses on a service-based-view versus a programmatic-view of cybersecurity. Critical services are assessed
            against more than 80 cybersecurity controls grouped under five top-level domains: cybersecurity management,
            cybersecurity forces, cybersecurity controls, cyber incident response, and cyber dependencies. A CIS provides
            your organization with an effective assessment of cybersecurity controls in-place for critical services to
            support cybersecurity planning, resource allocation, and performance evaluation.</p>
