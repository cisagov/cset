                                Resilience Review (CRR) Self-Assessment</a> provides a measure of
                        an organization’s cyber resilience capabilities. The
                        CRR Self-Assessment also enables an organization to assess its capabilities relative to
                        v1.1 of the
                        National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) with
                        CRR results
                        depicted in terms of the NIST CSF. A facilitator should review the CRR Method
                        Description and
                        Self-Assessment User Guide as a starting point for preparing and executing the CRR
                        Self-Assessment.</p>

                <h5>The CRR Assessment</h5>

                <p>The CRR is a lightweight, interview-based assessment method that was created by
                        the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for the purpose of evaluating the
                        cybersecurity and service
                        continuity practices of critical infrastructure owners and operators. The <a
                                href="{{configSvc.docUrl}}htmlhelp_crr/index.html">CRR
                                Self-Assessment</a>, consisting of 10 domains of practice with
                        299 questions, is typically delivered in a six-hour interactive workshop. Each
                        domain represents
                        important capabilities that contribute to the cyber resilience of an organization. The
                        number of goals
                        and practice questions varies by domain, but the set of Maturity Indicator Level (MIL)
                        questions and the
                        concepts they encompass are the same for all domains. The MIL questions examine the
                        institutionalization
                        of practices within an organization.</p>

                <p>The CRR reflects an organization’s capabilities at a single point in time—at
                        the time of the assessment. It seeks to understand the cybersecurity management of
                        business services,
                        and their associated assets, that are critical for an organization’s mission success.
                        The CRR measures
                        essential cybersecurity capabilities and behaviors to provide meaningful indicators of
                        an organization’s
                        operational resilience during normal operations and during times of operational
                        stress.</p>

                <p>The assessment does not consider:</p>
                <ul class="mb-4">
                        <li>activities that are planned
                                or are in the process of implementation</li>
                        <li>practices that have not been
                                performed for extended periods of time. For example, if the organization has a disaster
                                recovery plan
                                that, in the opinion of the participants, is out of date to the point of being unusable,
                                the plan should
                                not be considered.</li>
                </ul>
        </div>


        <div class="mb-4">
                <h5>Critical Service Scope</h5>

                <p><span>The CRR has a service-oriented approach, meaning that it is intended to assess
                                the organization's management of a specific mission critical service. Scoping the
                                assessment is critical
                                because answers to the CRR questions must be provided in relation to a specific service
                                and the assets
                                that underpin that service.</span></p>

                <p><span>A critical service must be selected, and is defined as: </span></p>
                <p><span>A set of activities an organization carries out in the performance of a duty or
                                in the production of a product that is so critical to the organization's success that
                                its disruption
                                would severely impact continued operations or success in meeting the organization's
                                mission.</span>
                </p>

                <p><span>Organizations typically have a set of critical services that define their
                                mission. The selection of a critical service for assessment—rather than assessing the
                                organization as a
                                whole—helps to scope the assessment and tie the results to the organization's
                                mission. </span>
                </p>

                <p><span>Below are some examples of organizations and their typical critical services
                                that might be selected as part of a CRR Self-Assessment:</span></p>
                <ul class="mb-4">
                        <li>banks and other financial
                                institutions: clearing and settlement, mortgage application processing</li>
                        <li>emergency services
                                providers: processing 911 calls, dispatch</li>
                        <li>electrical power plants:
                                electricity generation, electricity distribution</li>
                        <li>hospitals: clinical
                                services, prescription management</li>
                        <li>government agencies: court
                                case management, benefit management</li>
                        <li>manufacturing companies:
                                machining operations, order processing</li>
                        <li>airports: air traffic
                                control, fuel management</li>

        <div class="mb-4">
                <h5>Practice Questions Structure</h5>

                <p>Each practice question contains a 3-point response scale to evaluate the degree
                        to which the organization has implemented each practice. Each question has three
                        possible answers:
                        “Yes”, “Incomplete”, and “No”: </p>

                                        Level (MIL)</span></a><span> questions. The MIL questions examine the
                                institutionalization of CRR practices within an organization. Institutionalization
                                means that
                                cybersecurity practices become a deeper, more lasting part of the organization because
                                they are managed
                                and supported in meaningful ways. When cybersecurity practices become more
                                institutionalized—or
                                “embedded”—managers can have more confidence in the practices’ predictability and
                                reliability. The
                                practices also become more likely to be sustained during times of disruption or stress
                                to the
                                organization.</span></p>

                <p>A Maturity Indicator Level (MIL) is assigned to the each CRR domain. It
                        represents a consolidated view of performance. The
                        MIL scale
                        itself uses six maturity levels, each with rigorous, defined components:</p>

                <h6>MIL0 Incomplete</h6>
                <div><span>All practices in the domain are not being fully performed as measured by
                                responses to the relevant CRR questions in the domain.</span></div>

                <h6>MIL1 Performed</h6>
                <div><span>All practices that support the goals in a domain are being performed as
                                measured by responses to the relevant CRR questions.</span></div>

                <h6>MIL2 Planned</h6>
                <div><span>All specific practices in the CRR domain are not only performed but are also
                                supported by planning, policy, stakeholders, and relevant standards and
                                guidelines.</span></div>

                <h6>MIL3 Managed</h6>
                <div><span>All practices in a domain are performed, planned, and have the basic governance
                                infrastructure in place, are appropriately staffed, adequately funded and managed for

                <div><span>All practices in a domain are performed, planned, managed, monitored, and
                                controlled. A measured process or practice is periodically evaluated for effectiveness,
                                evaluated
                                against its practice description and plan, and periodically reviewed with higher level
                                management.</span></div>

                <h6>MIL5 Defined</h6>
                <div><span>All practices in a domain are performed, planned, managed, measured, and
                                consistent across all constituencies within an organization who have a vested interest

                                performance of the practice. At MIL5, a process or practice is defined by the
                                organization and tailored
                                by individual operating units and supported by improvement information that is collected
                                by and shared
                                among operating units for the overall benefit of the organization.</span></div>

                <div class="mb-3"><span>In the above progression, an organization can only attain a given MIL if it has
                                attained all lower MILs. In other words, an organization that fails to perform all of
                                the cybersecurity
                                practices at MIL1 in a domain would also fail to reach MIL2 in that domain, even if it
                                would have
                                satisfied all the requirements at MIL2. </span></div>
