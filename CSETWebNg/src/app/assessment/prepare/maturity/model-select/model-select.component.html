          The Capability Maturity Model Certification (CMMC) measures
          cybersecurity maturity with five levels and aligns a set of processes and
          practices with the type and sensitivity of information to be protected
          and the associated range of threats. The model consists of maturity
          processes and cybersecurity best practices from multiple
          cybersecurity standards, frameworks and other references,
          as well as inputs from the broader community.
        </p>

        <p>CMMC is broken into five different levels of Processes and Capabilities (which are further broken down into
          Practices).</p>

        <p>
          Ransomware poses an increasing threat and continues to rise as a top cyber threat impacting both businesses
          and government agencies. Ransomware is a type of malicious attack where attackers encrypt an organization's
          data and demand payment to restore access. In some instances, attackers may also steal an organization's
          information and demand an additional payment in return for not disclosing the information to authorities,
          competitors, or the public. Ransomware disrupts or halts an organization's operations and poses a dilemma for
          management: pay the ransom and hope that the attackers keep their word about restoring access and not
          disclosing data, or do not pay the ransom and restore operations themselves. The methods used to gain access
          to an organization's information and systems are common to cyberattacks more broadly, but they are aimed at
          forcing a ransom to be paid. Ransomware attacks target the organization's data.
        </p>
        <p>
          To understand your cybersecurity posture and assess how well your organization is equipped to defend and
          recover from a ransomware incident, take the Ransomware Readiness Assessment (RRA).
