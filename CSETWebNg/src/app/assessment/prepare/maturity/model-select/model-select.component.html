          The Capability Maturity Model Certification (CMMC) measures
          cybersecurity maturity with five levels and aligns a set of processes
          and practices with the type and sensitivity of information to be
          protected and the associated range of threats. The model consists of
          maturity processes and cybersecurity best practices from multiple
          cybersecurity standards, frameworks and other references, as well as
          inputs from the broader community.
        </p>

        <p>
          CMMC is broken into five different levels of Processes and
          Capabilities (which are further broken down into Practices).

          Ransomware poses an increasing threat and continues to rise as a top
          cyber threat impacting both businesses and government agencies.
          Ransomware is a type of malicious attack where attackers encrypt an
          organization's data and demand payment to restore access. In some
          instances, attackers may also steal an organization's information and
          demand an additional payment in return for not disclosing the
          information to authorities, competitors, or the public. Ransomware
          disrupts or halts an organization's operations and poses a dilemma for
          management: pay the ransom and hope that the attackers keep their word
          about restoring access and not disclosing data, or do not pay the
          ransom and restore operations themselves. The methods used to gain
          access to an organization's information and systems are common to
          cyberattacks more broadly, but they are aimed at forcing a ransom to
          be paid. Ransomware attacks target the organization's data.
        </p>

          To understand your cybersecurity posture and assess how well your
          organization is equipped to defend and recover from a ransomware
          incident, take the Ransomware Readiness Assessment (RRA).
