  <h2>Purpose of the Implementation Guide</h2>
  <div>
    <p>
      The Implementation Guide describes the principles of Cyber-Informed Engineering (CIE) and outlines questions 
      that engineering teams should consider during each phase of a system’s lifecycle to effectively employ these principles. 
      It describes what it means to address cyber threats to worker safety, public safety, the environment, to equipment 
      and to efficient, uninterrupted operations, rather than offering a comprehensive, step-by-step process or procedure for 
      CIE implementation. This guide complements—but does not replace—the application of cybersecurity standards or practices 
      currently in place within an organization.
    </p>
    <p>
      Engineers and technicians that design critical energy infrastructure installations can use the Implementation Guide to 
      integrate the 12 principles of CIE into each phase of the engineering lifecycle, from concept to retirement. The guide 
      is aimed at system or design engineers, rather than software engineers or operational cybersecurity practitioners. That 
      is because the engineers who design, build, operate, and maintain the physical infrastructure are best positioned to 
      leverage a system’s engineering design to diminish the severity of cyber-attacks or digital technology failures.
    </p>
    <p>
      CIE expands cybersecurity decisions into the engineering space, not by asking engineers to become cyber experts, 
      but by calling on engineers to apply engineering tools and make engineering decisions that improve cybersecurity outcomes. 
      CIE examines the engineering consequences that a sophisticated cyber attacker could achieve, and drives engineering changes 
      that may provide deterministic mitigations to limit or eliminate those consequences.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h4>CIE and “Secure-by-Design” Concepts</h4>
  <div>
    <p>
      CIE extends “secure-by-design” concepts beyond information technology (IT) and software engineering to include the engineering of cyber-physical systems. Secure-by-design approaches typically describe a shift in focus for software developers from finding and patching vulnerabilities to eliminating the design flaws in the software architecture that enable those vulnerabilities. CIE extends this concept beyond software design, introducing cybersecurity considerations that engineers can address at the earliest stages of system engineering, long before the incorporation of software and security controls.
    </p>
    <p>
      Traditionally, engineering design teams have not recognized the opportunity to address cyber risk to physical operations in systems through initial design and engineering decisions. These opportunities, if missed, are often costly or even impossible to implement later in the development process, potentially leaving in place cyber risks that security teams must endlessly manage and monitor. Enabling cyber risk management considerations at the beginning of the system lifecycle not only avoids this outcome but creates new opportunities to secure the system using physics and mechanics, not just digital monitoring and controls.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additionally, this practice allows the engineering team—which is ultimately responsible for identifying and mitigating functional and security risks for the system—to better tailor digital system protections according to the overall system risk and to consider impacts of digital failure or cyber-attack into the overall system development process.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ultimately, the use of Cyber-Informed Engineering to address cyber-physical risks will be recognized as part of the overall “standard of care” for engineering design. While these concepts cost least to implement when considering the design of a new system, they are useful to consider even for a currently existing system to eliminate many kinds of unacceptable outcomes of cyber compromise, and eliminate many kinds of cyber threats to physical operations that system employs for digital failure or cybersecurity risk.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h4>Proactive Collaboration Required to Effectively Use the Guide</h4>
  <div>
    <p>
      System or design engineers applying the CIE principles will require proactive collaboration with other engineering disciplines, as well as IT and cybersecurity specialists and other business units. Effectively answering the questions laid out in the guide requires a multi-stakeholder approach to systems and engineering design, where security, risk management, and other business function leaders’ team up with engineers early in system design. This enables a shift in systems engineering that will create a culture of cybersecurity aligned with the existing industry safety culture.
