        <h4>Overview</h4>
        <p>In general, a security model is a set of characteristics, attributes, indicators, or patterns that represent
            capability and
            progression in a particular discipline. The content of such a model typically exemplifies best practices and
            may incorporate
            standards or other codes of practice of that discipline. A security model thus provides a benchmark against
            which an
            organization can evaluate the current level of capability of its processes, practices, and methods and set
            goals and
            priorities for improvement.</p>

        <p>The CMMC assessment process provides consistent guidance for assessing a contractor against a specific CMMC
            level.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="mb-4">
        <h5>Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC)</h5>
        <p>
            CMMC stands for “Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification” and is a unifying standard for the
            implementation of cybersecurity across the Defense Industrial Base (DIB). The CMMC framework includes a
            comprehensive and scalable certification element to verify the implementation of processes and practices
            associated with the achievement of a cybersecurity maturity level. CMMC is designed to provide increased
            assurance to the Department that a DIB company can adequately protect sensitive unclassified information,
            accounting for information flow down to subcontractors in a multi-tier supply chain.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="mb-4">
        <h5>CMMC Levels and Focus Areas</h5>
        <p>
            CMMC Levels 1 through 3 consist of the security requirements specified in National Institute of Standards
            and Technology
            (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-171, Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information in Nonfederal
            Systems and
            Organizations. Levels 1 through 3 also include an additional 20 CMMC specific- practices along with 3 CMMC
            maturity
            processes for each of the 17 CMMC domains.
        </p>

        <p>
            CMMC Levels 4 and 5 include a subset of the enhanced security requirements from NIST SP 800-171B as well as
            other
            cybersecurity best practices and show that the contractor is capable of reducing the risk of Advanced
            Persistent Threats.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a contractor moves toward Level 5, they are required to standardize and optimize process implementation
            across the organization.

        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="mb-4">
        <h5>Setting the Target Level</h5>

        <p>
            The first step to completing the CMMC practice questions is to set your desired target level. If you are
            unsure of your
            target level, check your RFI or RFP documents for the required CMMC compliance level for your contract or
            choose your
            level based on the following guidance. Additional guidance on CMMC Levels can be found in the CSET Resource
            Library's
            collection of CMMC materials. Recommended reading includes the

    <div class="image-caption">Figure 1: CMMC Levels and Associated Focus Areas</div>


    <div class="mb-4">
        <h5>Level 1</h5>

        <p>
            Level 1 safeguards Federal Contract Information (FCI). Level 1 encompasses the basic safeguarding
            requirements for
            FCI specified in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Clause 52.204-21, which defines FCI as:
        </p>

        <p>
            <em>Information, not intended for public release, that is provided by or generated for the Government under
                a contract to develop
                or deliver a product or service to the Government, but not including information provided by the
                Government to the public (such
                as on public websites) or simple transactional information, such as necessary to process payments.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            Department of Defense (DoD) contracts that specify the need for a contractor to process, store, or transmit
            FCI only require
            the contractor to comply with CMMC Level 1 practices. There is no CMMC process maturity assessed at Level 1.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="mb-4">
        <h5>Level 2</h5>
        <p>
            Level 2 is a transitional level. At Level 2, a contractor is not yet approved for CUI. CMMC Level 2
            practices and processes
            provide additional safeguarding above CMMC Level 1 and help to prepare a contractor to handle CUI at CMMC
            Level 3.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="mb-4">
        <h5>Level 3</h5>
        <p>
            CMMC Level 3 addresses the protection of Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI). The National Archives
            and Record Administration (NARA) defines CUI as:
        </p>
        <p><em>
                Information that requires safeguarding or dissemination controls pursuant to and consistent with laws,
                regulations, and government-wide policies, excluding information that is classified under Executive
                Order 13526, Classified National Security
                Information, December 29, 2009, or any predecessor or successor order, or Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as
                amended.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            A CMMC Level 3 assessment encompasses the practices and processes of CMMC Levels 1, 2, and 3. CMMC Level 3
            shows
            that a contractor can adequately protect CUI at the appropriate risk level while accounting for
            subcontractor information
            flow in a multi-tier supply chain.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="mb-4">
        <h5>Level 4</h5>
        <p>
            Level 4 provides increased assurance to the DoD that a contractor is capable of protecting CUI while
            working to reduce the
            risk of Advanced Persistent Threats and focuses on the protection of CUI from APTs. It encompasses
            cybersecurity best
            practices along with enhanced security requirements from NIST SP 800-171B . These practices enhance the
            detection and
            response capabilities of an organization to address and adapt to the changing tactics, techniques and
            procedures (TTPs) used
            by APTs.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="mb-4">
        <h5>Level 5</h5>
        <p>
            Level 5 continues the focus on the protection of CUI from APTs and requires a contractor to standardize and
            optimize process implementation across the organization.
        </p>
    </div>


    <div class="mb-4">
        <h4>CMMC Practice Questions</h4>

        <p> The CMMC model measures not only process maturity or institutionalization, but also the implementation of
            practices.
            The model consists of 171 practices that are mapped across the five levels for all capabilities and domains.
            This mapping
            and the cumulative nature of the model is shown in Figure 2 below.
