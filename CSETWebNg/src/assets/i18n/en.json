It is not a risk analysis tool so it will not generate a complex risk assessment. CSET® is not intended as a substitute for in depth analysis of control system vulnerabilities as performed by trained professionals. Periodic onsite reviews and inspections must still be conducted using a holistic approach including facility walk downs, interviews, and observation and examination of facility practices. Consideration should also be given to additional steps including scanning, penetration testing, and exercises on surrogate, training, or non-production systems, or systems where failures, unexpected faults, or other unexpected results will not compromise production or safety.",
