Remove unsupported hardware and software. Supported hardware and software generally allow you to receive updates and patches for vulnerabilities that otherwise are not available for unsupported assets.

If hardware or software is unsupported, yet necessary for the fulfillment of the enterprise’s mission, document an exception detailing mitigating controls and residual risk acceptance. For any unsupported hardware or software without an exception documentation, designate as unauthorized. Review the hardware and software list to periodically verify support.

Operational environments may present unique requirements. The security challenges facing Industrial Control Systems (ICS) will require additional attention and consideration. For example, many utilize proprietary protocols and may not have the ability to support security software that is commonly used in a traditional Information Technology (IT) environment.

ICS network architectures typically differ from traditional IT environments and may require the organization to employ compensating controls. Applying security controls to ICS often rely on segmentation and boundary control between the IT and OT domains, and careful control design around local and remote connectivity to reduce attack vectors used to gain access to ICS networks.

A single point of failure means that a single disruption or interruption involving an external entity would cause a failure or significant disruption of the critical service. An example of a single point of failure is a supplier that is the sole source of a critical service or critical asset, and for whom there is no substitute readily available (i.e., on standby or actively operating in parallel).

This question asks about a specific risk management practice and requires that single points of failure be identified and managed as risks (i.e., formally accepted, mitigated, transferred, monitored, etc.).

Failure to recognize single points of failure may result in neither the organization nor relevant external entities putting sufficient controls and mitigations in place to guard against this risk.

Single points of failure need not be organizations with which the organization has a formal agreement or direct relationship. For example:
<ul>
<li>Two or more of the organization''s suppliers may rely on a third party or "second-tier" supplier.</li>
<li>Multiple suppliers (for example, two outsourced data centers) may be in the same geographic region and therefore subject to the same natural disaster.</li>

An operational risk management plan provides a common foundation for the performance of risk management activities.

Operational risk is defined as the potential impact on assets and their related services that could result from inadequate or failed internal processes, failures of systems or technology, deliberate or inadvertent actions of people, or external events (weather, disasters, war, etc.).

The critical service''s resilience requirements may not be codified in formal agreements with suppliers for a variety of reasons. For example, the requirements may have changed or the organization may have insufficient negotiating power to compel suppliers to agree to all of the relevant requirements.

For business reasons organizations will often accept this risk. However, the organization ultimately owns the risk of failures of the critical service. Therefore, any time a supplier agrees to support the critical service without sufficient protections and controls, this situation should be monitored as an open risk.
