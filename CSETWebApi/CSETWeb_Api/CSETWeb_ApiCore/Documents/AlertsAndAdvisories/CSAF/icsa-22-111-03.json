          "text": "The Raccoon attack exploits a flaw in the TLS specification that can lead to an attacker being able to compute the pre-master secret in connections which have used a Diffie-Hellman (DH) based ciphersuite. This would result in the attacker being able to eavesdrop on all encrypted communications sent over that TLS connection. The attack can only be exploited if an implementation re-uses a DH secret across multiple TLS connections. Note this vulnerability only impacts DH ciphersuites and not ECDH ciphersuites. This vulnerability affects OpenSSL 1.0.2, which is out of support and no longer receiving public updates. OpenSSL 1.1.1 is not vulnerable to this issue. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2w (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2v).CVE-2020-1968 has been assigned to this vulnerability.
