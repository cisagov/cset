The buffer overflow happens in the task calling recv()/recvfrom()/recvmsg(). Applications that pass a buffer equal to or larger than a full TCP window are not susceptible to this attack. Applications passing a stack-allocated variable as a buffer are the easiest to exploit. The most likely outcome is a crash of the application reading from the affected socket, which could result in remote code execution.. CVE-2019-12260 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).The most likely outcome is a crash of the application reading from the affected socket, which could result in remote code execution.",

The buffer overflow happens in the task calling recv()/recvfrom()/recvmsg(). Applications that pass a buffer equal to or larger than a full TCP window are not susceptible to this attack. Applications passing a stack-allocated variable as a buffer are the easiest to exploit. The most likely outcome is a crash of the application reading from the affected socket, which could result in remote code execution.. CVE-2019-12261 has been assigned to this vulnerability.
