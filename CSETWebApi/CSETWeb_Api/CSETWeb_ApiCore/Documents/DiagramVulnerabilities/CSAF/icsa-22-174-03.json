Initial footholds through S-Web interface software vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to obtain a level of control over the PLC's functions only the vendor typically has access to. This includes the ability to reset the PLC, upload arbitrary files / execute code, and change parameters for protective functions that can pose a range of availability and safety risks to the power system the PLC is configured to control (based on the specific implementation). Further exploitation of the underlying PLC misconfigurations can allow an attacker to trivially escalate privileges to OS root through either the S-Web vulnerabilities or FTP and SSH misconfigurations.",
