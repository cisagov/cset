<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p">The following initiation scenarios are provided as an overview of typical security vulnerabilities associated with shared control system and business system infrastructure or control systems connected to other external networks (hereafter any non-control system is referred to as an external network). It is intended that this information will stimulate thought and discussion for the team performing a CSET assessment, specifically, in determining a SAL. This overview is not intended to be a comprehensive review of all potential threats or vulnerabilities.</div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p">Three aspects must be considered when assessing the security posture of a control system:</div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="Subtitle"><strong>Availability.</strong></span> The system must be ready and able to store and transmit data when needed. </div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="Subtitle"><strong>Integrity.</strong></span> The data stored or transmitted by the system must be complete and correct (not corrupted). </div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="Subtitle"><strong>Confidentiality.</strong></span> The system must be able to store and transmit data without unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information. </div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p">The following pages describe a typical ICS/external network environment and provide examples of risks, exposures, and vulnerabilities that are commonly encountered in such environments.</div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p h2"><h2>Typical Mixed-Use Control/External Network Environment</h2></div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p">In a typical mixed-use environment, there is separation between ICSs and external networks, but both rely on some amount of shared infrastructure (e.g., communications links). Although separated, some connectivity between these networks exists (e.g., public web or application servers).</div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p">There are typically distinct but interconnected networks, including the following: </div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="Subtitle"><strong>Control System.</strong></span> The control system consists of servers, workstations, and devices associated with the ICSs. Multiple separate systems may be in use and individual systems may span multiple sites.</div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="Subtitle"><strong>Business Network.</strong></span> The business network consists of servers and workstations associated with typical office productivity applications, such as email and word processing, as well as specialized applications such as for human resources, payroll, and billing.</div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="Subtitle"><strong>Other Networks.</strong></span> These consist of other city, state, federal, or outside agency networks connected via dedicated communications, Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), or other means. Typically, access from such networks is controlled via a firewall. Connections to other networks may be trusted or untrusted.</div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="Subtitle"><strong>Internet.</strong></span> For the public Internet, typically, access is allowed to the outside for business use (e.g., email, web browsing) and limited services may be accessed externally (e.g., web access to public information). Such access is controlled via a firewall, and the Internet is treated as an untrusted network.</div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="Subtitle"><strong>Shared Infrastructure.</strong></span> While the ICS and business environments are distinct, there are touch points between them. </div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p">Because of the costs and complexity associated with wide area networks, it is common to allow both ICS and normal business communications to share the same physical infrastructure. </div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p">The need to share information may drive the use of portals between networks in a dual-homed configuration with direct connection to both networks, or shared servers may be placed on a DMZ network between the ICS and the business.</div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p">ICS personnel with the need for business application access may be provided workstations that are dual-homed or provided access to the business network from their ICS workstations, or vice versa.</div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p">It is important to appreciate the complexity of ensuring security in such environments. </div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p">While individual products, systems, or networks may be secure when taken individually, they may not be adequately secured or protected in a complex deployment.</div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p h2"><h2>Common Initiation Scenarios</h2></div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p">The following scenarios describe common security issues that can initiate a worst-case scenario. The scenarios could impact the operation of a facility causing damage, loss of production, impacts to health, safety, and the environment, or other economic impacts. These issues could, in turn, impact system availability, integrity, and confidentiality in a typical mixed-use environment. These scenarios are provided as food for thought in developing an organization’s worst-case scenario and the resulting consequences.</div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="T1"><strong>Scenario 1: Privilege Escalation</strong></span></div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p">In this scenario, an unknown party (attacker) is able to access sensitive data or systems by means of existing network connections. This access may be gained by a number of means, including:</div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="Subtitle"><strong>Insufficiently Protected Networks.</strong></span> Restrictions between networks may be nonexistent, poorly implemented, or may rely on excessive levels of trust between networks.</div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="Subtitle"><strong>Privilege Escalation.</strong></span> The outsider, or in some cases an insider, may access a public or loosely secured system with limited functionality and then use that system to hop to more sensitive functions. By hopping between systems, the attacker appears to be operating from inside the trusted network.</div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="Subtitle"><strong>Poorly Secured Resources.</strong></span> A determined attacker can potentially exploit a number of system weaknesses, including but certainly not limited to the following: </div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<ul class="de_list"><li class="list-element list-counter-53" style="color:#000000;font-size:11pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;; direction: ltr; counter-reset: list-counter-53;">
<div class="p de_0711D341CE"><div class="list-marker" style="color:#000000;font-size:11pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;; display: inline-block; direction: ltr;"></div><span class="Bullet">Unsecured Default Accounts. The attacker leverages widely known default accounts and passwords to gain access.</span></div>
</li></ul><div class="p de_0711D341CE">&#160;</div>
<ul class="de_list"><li class="list-element list-counter-54" style="color:#000000;font-size:11pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;; direction: ltr; counter-reset: list-counter-54;">
<div class="p de_0711D341CE"><div class="list-marker" style="color:#000000;font-size:11pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;; display: inline-block; direction: ltr;"></div><span class="Bullet">Poorly Secured Services. The attacker uses weaknesses in running services and applications to gain access to increased access levels (i.e., gaining access to sensitive system files).</span></div>
</li></ul><div class="p de_0711D341CE">&#160;</div>
<ul class="de_list"><li class="list-element list-counter-55" style="color:#000000;font-size:11pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;; direction: ltr; counter-reset: list-counter-55;">
<div class="p de_0711D341CE"><div class="list-marker" style="color:#000000;font-size:11pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;; display: inline-block; direction: ltr;"></div><span class="Bullet">Weak Network Services. The attacker uses known vulnerabilities in services and applications to execute programs to gain further levels of access.</span></div>
</li></ul><div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p">The attacker might proceed as follows:</div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p de_0711D341CE"><span class="Bullet">1) Identifying the software running on the web server. While doing simple Internet searches, the attacker locates software capable of exploiting vulnerabilities within the web server software or the current configuration of the server to allow execution of programs on the web server.</span></div>
<div class="p de_0711D341CE">&#160;</div>
<div class="p de_0711D341CE"><span class="Bullet">2) Executing a remote shell (command prompt) on the web server to launch software identifying internal hosts. Upon discovery of an interesting server (the Control System Historian in this example), the attacker attempts to gain access using well-known default accounts (i.e., Guest), eventually discovering a little-used account with a default, or easily guessed password to gain access.</span></div>
<div class="p de_0711D341CE">&#160;</div>
<div class="p de_0711D341CE"><span class="Bullet">3) Using the trust associated with the control system Historian to gain access to the ICS network. In poorly secured systems, there may be excessive trust between inside servers and the ICS, which can allow easy access. Once in, the attacker uses additional probes to gain access to ICSs and to install software, view and manipulate data, or perform any other desired function.</span></div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p">Any such intrusion impacts the ICS network at multiple levels:</div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="Subtitle"><strong>Availability.</strong></span> Through intentional or accidental reconfiguration, the attacker may disable essential system services, or introduce software (i.e., spam generators) that disrupts the network because of the traffic loads generated.</div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="Subtitle"><strong>Integrity.</strong></span> Unauthorized manipulation of data can be done at the attacker’s whim. This may range from simple curious tinkering to direct attempts to impact the ICS.</div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="Subtitle"><strong>Confidentiality.</strong></span> Sensitive system functions may be identified, and data may be accessed and disseminated to unknown third parties.</div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="T1"><strong>Scenario 2: Traffic Sniffing</strong></span></div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p">In this scenario, shared network infrastructure (e.g., hubs, switches, routers) is used for both the ICS and business. An unauthorized user (attacker) on a non-ICS network is able to sniff network traffic and capture login credentials (username, password), sensitive data, and network information. </div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p">The attacker might proceed as follows:</div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p de_0711D341CE"><span class="Bullet">1) In a direct attempt to sabotage the ICS, or simply out of curiosity, the attacker installs packet capture (sniffer) software to monitor traffic on the network. This software is capable of capturing any visible traffic and may include the means to circumvent protection offered by switches. In an extreme case, the attacker can use man-in-the-middle attacks to circumvent encryption. Such software can be monitored in real time or simply run in the background to capture traffic of interest. In particular, user login IDs and passwords can be captured in this manner.</span></div>
<div class="p de_0711D341CE">&#160;</div>
<div class="p de_0711D341CE"><span class="Bullet">2) An authorized user eventually connects to the ICS using authentication credentials (username and password). Because of weaknesses in the application, the password is not encrypted or is encrypted using weak and easily circumvented techniques.</span></div>
<div class="p de_0711D341CE">&#160;</div>
<div class="p de_0711D341CE"><span class="Bullet">3) Having captured the login session, the attacker simply extracts the password from the network traffic stream (if clear text) or runs a password-cracking program against it (if encrypted). Once the user account details are known, the attacker is free to impersonate that user and gain access to the ICS.</span></div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p">Any such attack impacts the ICS network at multiple levels:</div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="Subtitle"><strong>Availability.</strong></span> The attacker may intentionally or inadvertently disable the user account. Changes to device configurations may result in a loss of use.</div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="Subtitle"><strong>Integrity.</strong></span> With access into the system, the attacker can make further attempts to use the same credentials on other systems. Unauthorized manipulation of data can be done at the attacker’s whim. This may range from simple curious tinkering to directed attempts to impact the ICS.</div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="Subtitle"><strong>Confidentiality.</strong></span> Once user credentials are compromised, the attacker may impersonate the user at will. Sensitive system functions may be identified, and data may be accessed and disseminated to unknown third parties.</div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="T1"><strong>Scenario 3: Introduction of Malicious Software from Outside the System</strong></span></div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p">In this scenario, a workstation used by an authorized user is compromised by means of malicious software, or malware such as Trojan horses, viruses, or worms (in any combination). Such software is typically written to allow the attacker to generate spam emails. </div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p">The sequence of events might occur as follows:</div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p de_0711D341CE"><span class="Bullet">1) A user on an operator workstation with either connections into both networks (dual-homed) or an internal ICS workstation with access to the outside inadvertently downloads a program via an email attachment. Although most users know not to run programs from unknown outsiders, simple carelessness or a well-crafted social engineering message appearing to come from Network Support might convince them to launch the attached program. The program exploits vulnerability in the workstation operating system to install malware (a worm). Once installed, the worm begins replication thus filling the memory.</span></div>
<div class="p de_0711D341CE">&#160;</div>
<div class="p de_0711D341CE"><span class="Bullet">2) Eventually, the sheer volume of traffic generated by multiple copies of the worm running on the network overwhelms lower-speed Wide Area Network (WAN) links, resulting in loss of communications or a denial of service.</span></div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p">Any such attack impacts the ICS network at multiple levels, such as:</div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="Subtitle"><strong>Availability.</strong></span> The most likely impact is network disruption due to the sheer volume of worm-related traffic (e.g., probes, spam, and bounce email messages.) </div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="Subtitle"><strong>Integrity.</strong></span> Remote-control software allows the attacker unrestricted access to the compromised system. If the attacker has some means of accessing the system, unauthorized manipulation of data can be done at the attacker’s whim. This may range from simple curious tinkering to directed attempts to impact the ICS.</div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="Subtitle"><strong>Confidentiality.</strong></span> If remote-control software is installed, sensitive system functions may be identified and data accessed and disseminated to unknown third parties. </div>
