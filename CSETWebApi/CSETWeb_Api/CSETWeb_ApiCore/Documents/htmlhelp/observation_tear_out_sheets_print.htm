<div class="p">Observation records are identified and associated with individual questions during the assessment. As infrastructure or processes are evaluated during the assessment process, there are times when problems or issues are identified. These problems can be recorded and associated with the question under review. The Observation Tear Out Sheets contain a list of all observation records identified during the assessment. The report is formatted such that each observation can be assigned to a person responsible for its resolution and easily assigned.</div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
