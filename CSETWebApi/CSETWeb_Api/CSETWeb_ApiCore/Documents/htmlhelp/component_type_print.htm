<div class="p"><span class="de_4AF4BF9DD6">Below the chart is a grid with detailed numerical data that supports the chart. The component type is listed first and matches the types shown in the chart above. The next column shows the number of components of a type that are present on the diagram. The next fields are the number of each answer with a total that is calculated by multiplying the total number of components with the number of questions per component. </span></div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="de_4AF4BF9DD6">There may be situations where you could have two components of the same type and the number of questions is an odd number. This happens when each component is in a different zone that has different security assurance level (SAL) values. For example, a component in a zone with a Low SAL may have 4 questions presented while the same component in a High SAL may have 7 questions. In this case the total number of questions would be 11 for the two components of the same type.</span></div>
