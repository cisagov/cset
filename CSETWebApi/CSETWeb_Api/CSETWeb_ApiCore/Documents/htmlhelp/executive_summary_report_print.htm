				<td class="page_area" style="border-color: #ffffff; width: 100%;"><div class="description_on_page"><div class="p" style="text-align: center; direction: ltr; margin-left: 0px; text-indent: 0px;"><h1><strong>Executive Summary Report</strong></h1></div>
<div class="p" style="text-align: left; direction: ltr; margin-left: 0px; text-indent: 0px;">&#160;</div>
<div class="p" style="text-align: left; direction: ltr; margin-left: 0px; text-indent: 0px;">The Executive Summary Report is designed for an executive level audience. The intent is to provide limited graphical and high level, summary information that can be understood quickly. </div>
<div class="p" style="text-align: left; direction: ltr; margin-left: 0px; text-indent: 0px;">&#160;</div>
<div class="p" style="text-align: left; direction: ltr; margin-left: 0px; text-indent: 0px;">This report is limited to around five or six pages and does not include any detailed information beyond listing the top categories and areas of concern. It does include the textual Executive Summary and Description of Assessment text that was entered by the user at the Information screen. Some default text is provided; however, the default text should be replaced with actual summary information that captures the highlights of the assessment.</div>
<div class="p" style="text-align: left; direction: ltr; margin-left: 0px; text-indent: 0px;">&#160;</div>
<div class="p" style="text-align: left; direction: ltr; margin-left: 0px; text-indent: 0px;">The Executive Summary Report has a fixed set of sections that are all generated when the report is created. Each of the sections in the report will be discussed below.</div>
<div class="p" style="text-align: left; direction: ltr; margin-left: 0px; text-indent: 0px;">&#160;</div>
<div class="p" style="text-align: left; direction: ltr; margin-left: 0px; text-indent: 0px;"><span class="T1"><strong>Title Page:</strong></span> Each of the reports has a cover page that is unique to the report type. Each includes the assessment name that is taken from the Information screen in the tool, the date that was entered in the Assessment Date field, and the name of the person that was entered in the Principal Assessor/Name field in the Information screen.</div>
<div class="p" style="text-align: left; direction: ltr; margin-left: 0px; text-indent: 0px;">&#160;</div>
<div class="p" style="text-align: left; direction: ltr; margin-left: 0px; text-indent: 0px;"><span class="T1"><strong>Description and Summary:</strong></span> This is the first page with content and shows a summary look at the Standards, network components, and overall compliance based on answers to questions in the assessment. It also includes the description of the assessment and the executive summary text that was entered in the Information screen.</div>
<div class="p" style="text-align: left; direction: ltr; margin-left: 0px; text-indent: 0px;">&#160;</div>
<div class="p" style="text-align: left; direction: ltr; margin-left: 0px; text-indent: 0px;">When CSET is installed, the Executive Summary field has generic text included as a starting point; however, once the assessment is complete, the included text should be replaced with executive summary text that is specific to the actual assessment results.</div>
<div class="p" style="text-align: left; direction: ltr; margin-left: 0px; text-indent: 0px;">&#160;</div>
<div class="p" style="text-align: left; direction: ltr; margin-left: 0px; text-indent: 0px;"><span class="T1"><strong>Standards Summary:</strong></span> The Evaluation Against Selected Standards displays several items. It first identifies the Standards that were used in the evaluation. It then shows in pie chart format the combined breakout of answers for the selected Standards. The bar chart provides the greatest level of detail and indicates the overall scoring in each question category for the selected Standards.</div>
<div class="p" style="text-align: left; direction: ltr; margin-left: 0px; text-indent: 0px;">&#160;</div>
<div class="p" style="text-align: left; direction: ltr; margin-left: 0px; text-indent: 0px;">Because more than one Standard may be selected, the categories are not specific to a single Standard. Instead, the categories are taken from a common list that applies to all.</div>
<div class="p" style="text-align: left; direction: ltr; margin-left: 0px; text-indent: 0px;">&#160;</div>
<div class="p" style="text-align: left; direction: ltr; margin-left: 0px; text-indent: 0px;"><span class="T1"><strong>Component Analysis:</strong></span> Like the previous page, this also provides summary information but for the set of components in the network diagram. On this page, the user would see the combined summary of answers for all components in the pie chart. This is basically a percentage of all answers for all the combined component questions. The lower bar chart shows the scoring for each component type.</div>
<div class="p" style="text-align: left; direction: ltr; margin-left: 0px; text-indent: 0px;">&#160;</div>
<div class="p" style="text-align: left; direction: ltr; margin-left: 0px; text-indent: 0px;">Also reported is the number of warnings found by the basic network analysis. These are the red circle warnings that are shown in the diagram when the Analyze Network function has been enabled.</div>
<div class="p" style="text-align: left; direction: ltr; margin-left: 0px; text-indent: 0px;">&#160;</div>
<div class="p" style="text-align: left; direction: ltr; margin-left: 0px; text-indent: 0px;"><span class="T1"><strong>Areas of Concern:</strong></span> The final section of the Report shows the top subjects or categories and top questions of concern.</div>
<div class="p" style="text-align: left; direction: ltr; margin-left: 0px; text-indent: 0px;">&#160;</div>
<div class="p" style="text-align: left; direction: ltr; margin-left: 0px; text-indent: 0px;">The top questions and categories are based on the ranked order of both, and the full lists can be found in the Site Summary and the Site Detail reports. Both lists on this page have been limited to only the top five. The intent is to give a quick picture of what is recommended to be addressed first.</div>
<div class="p" style="text-align: left; direction: ltr; margin-left: 0px; text-indent: 0px;">&#160;</div>
<div class="p" style="text-align: left; direction: ltr; margin-left: 0px; text-indent: 0px;">If the user selected the Requirements or Cybersecurity Framework approach to the assessment, this section will deal with the requirements of concern, and the list will be the actual requirement text.</div>
<div class="p" style="text-align: left; direction: ltr; margin-left: 0px; text-indent: 0px;">&#160;</div>
<div class="p" style="text-align: left; direction: ltr; margin-left: 0px; text-indent: 0px;"><span class="Subtitle"><strong>Ranking:</strong></span> The list is based on a formula that includes the number of missed questions, the weighting given to each of those questions, the weighting assigned to the question category or area, the SAL for the question, and the criticality assignment for a component that was included in the diagram. </div>
<div class="p" style="text-align: left; direction: ltr; margin-left: 0px; text-indent: 0px;">&#160;</div>
<div class="p" style="text-align: left; direction: ltr; margin-left: 0px; text-indent: 0px;">All the parameters are factored together. Each question is ordered in the list from the question the user should work on first at the top to the question or requirement that should be addressed last listed on the bottom. </div>
