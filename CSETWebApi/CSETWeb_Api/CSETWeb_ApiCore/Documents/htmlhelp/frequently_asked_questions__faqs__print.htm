<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p">This is a list of questions that new users may find helpful.</div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="T1"><strong>My system is running slow. How can I make it go faster?</strong></span></div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="de_1FF6BF54A0">This release may run slower than previous releases of CSET. Check to make sure that there is sufficient RAM on the user's computer. 3 GB of RAM is recommended. Check the Task Manager to verify that the computer is not paging to the disk drive, which would cause a significant drop in performance. The delays typically come from the system loading and caching data between the main screens. There is a greater delay when using a large diagram or when multiple Standards are selected. A faster processor will also help.</span></div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="T1"><strong>How do I import a file from a previous release of CSET?</strong></span></div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="de_1FF6BF54A0">See</span><a class="local_link" href="import_export_a_cset_assessment.htm"><span class="de_FE04B87F3C"> Import a CSET Assessment</span></a><span class="de_4AF4BF9DD6"> for more information.</span></div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="T1"><strong>Why isn’t the Catalog of Recommendations available in Questions mode on the Standards screen?</strong></span></div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="de_1FF6BF54A0">The Catalog of Recommendations, Version 7 was the foundation for the Universal Questions and so to select it would be to double-select the same set of questions. To avoid confusion, it is not selectable in Questions mode.</span></div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="T1"><strong>What Standard should I use?</strong></span></div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="de_1FF6BF54A0">Only the user can answer that question for his or her organization; however, extensive help information can be found by reviewing the </span><a><span class="de_FE04B87F3C">Cybersecurity Standard Selection</span></a><span class="de_1FF6BF54A0"> help section. The user may also consult the User Guide available from the home screen. For a brief description of the available Standards, see the</span><span class="de_2BB7AA1836"> </span><a><span class="de_FE04B87F3C">CSET Standards and Question Groupings</span></a><span class="de_4AF4BF9DD6"> help section</span><span class="de_2BB7AA1836">. </span></div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="T1"><strong>Can I unclick an answer in the Questions screen after making a selection?</strong></span></div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="de_1FF6BF54A0">Yes. Simply click the button again to clear it. </span></div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="T1"><strong>I’ve lost my zone on the diagram. Where did it go?</strong></span></div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="de_1FF6BF54A0">Like other shapes, it may have been placed behind another zone or another shape. You can move or minimize the shapes to see if it is hidden behind them. You can also go to the Format tab and use the options found under the Commands menu to move zones and other shapes forward and backward in the view order. To quickly see what is behind a zone or shape, send it to the back. </span></div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="de_1FF6BF54A0">You might also check to see if it has been assigned to a layer that is not displayed. Click the Home tab and select Layers. Make sure all layers are checked. </span></div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="T1"><strong>I put in a text box on the diagram and want to change the style. How do I do it?</strong></span></div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="de_1FF6BF54A0">Text objects are placed onto the diagram while in the Format menu tab. The formatting can be found under the same tab or by clicking the gear icon to open the properties popup box. Go to Format, click on the text block, and make the changes using the Label Styles commands. You can change font, size, bold, italic, underline, color, and position.</span></div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="T1"><strong>I’m having trouble connecting components on the diagram. Is there a trick to it?</strong></span></div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="de_1FF6BF54A0">This can be a bit tricky, especially when there are multiple lines. First, click the Selector tool under the Format tab. Then, select the starting component. This will put a gray box around it. Click inside the gray border and hold the mouse down to drag the line to the second component. Hover over the center of the second component until the link area turns red, then click. The problem comes if you click that spot again to draw another line. The system may think you are trying to move the first line, not start a new one. Click outside of the component to finalize the first line before starting another from the same point. </span></div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="T1"><strong>I’m in the diagram and can’t seem to change modes. How do I know where I am and how do I change?</strong></span></div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="de_1FF6BF54A0">The selected mode or function is identified by a blue background on the icon. This could remain active even if you change menu options by selecting a new tab. Clicking on a different function will change the mode. For example, to stop creating text boxes, click on the Selector tool under the Format menu. There are cases where a function will remain active even with a new button clicked. For example, Analyze Network is a toggle switch that is independent of other actions. </span></div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="T1"><strong>Can I change properties on multiple objects at once?</strong></span></div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="de_1FF6BF54A0">Yes, you can select multiple objects; however, the only property that can be changed for all of them is the Layer. You can also use the multi-select to remove the unique flag and remove the question overrides, if there are any. To select multiple objects, you can drag a box around them with the Selector tool enabled in the Format tab. Unfortunately, this can often capture nearby, but unwanted, objects. Another method is to hold down the keyboard Control (Ctrl) key while clicking the desired objects with the mouse. </span></div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="T1"><strong>I have a Microsoft Visio diagram. Can I use it?</strong></span></div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="de_1FF6BF54A0">No, not with the current version of CSET. This will be a future option.</span></div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="T1"><strong>In the Components Summary Screen the number of Questions doesn't seem to add up. What is happening?</strong></span></div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="de_1FF6BF54A0">There may be a situation where you have two components of the same type and see an odd number of questions in the analysis screen. This would occur if the components are in zones with different security assurance levels (SALs). For example, an application server in a zone with a low SAL may have 10 associated questions and an application server in a zone with a high SAL may have 15 questions associated with it, due to the higher requirements. The total number of questions would be 25 for both servers. </span></div>
