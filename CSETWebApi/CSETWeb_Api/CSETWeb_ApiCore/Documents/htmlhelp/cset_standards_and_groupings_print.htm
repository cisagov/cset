The CIS Controls are especially relevant because they are updated by cyber experts based on actual attack data pulled from a variety of public and private threat sources. Version 6 incorporates recommended changes from the cybersecurity community to reflect the latest technologies and threats. The new Controls include a new Control for &quot;Email and Web Browser Protections,&quot; a deleted Control on &quot;Secure Network Engineering,&quot; and a re-ordering to make &quot;Controlled Use of Administration Privileges&quot; higher in priority. This version also includes a new metrics companion guide.</div>

Standard CIP-005-3 requires the identification and protection of the electronic security perimeters. Standard CIP-006-3 is intended to ensure the implementation of a physical security program. Standard CIP-007-3 requires responsible entities to define methods, processes, and procedures for securing those systems determined to be critical cyber assets.

The expansion of requirements to low impact assets has zero impact if you don’t have any. The same goes for the transient assets and removable media. While there aren’t many organizations in that situation, scope reduction is absolutely a valid strategy for any compliance program, NERC CIP compliance included.&#160; While it may seem obvious to state, don’t wait to determine how you’re going to address the updated NERC CIP standards. If there’s the potential for budgetary impact (and there is), the sooner you start planning, the better.</div>

Each CCI provides a standard identifier and description for &quot;singular, actionable statements” that comprise a security control or security best practice. The purpose of CCIs is to allow a high level statement made in a policy document (i.e., a security control) to be &quot;decomposed” and explicitly associated with the low-level security settings that must be assessed to determine compliance with the objectives of that specific statement. Under the leadership of the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), a working group has been cataloging CCIs for the past several years. The collection has now been developed to the point that every assessment objective in the NIST SP 800-53A has been mapped to an individual CCI. The current list of CCIs can be downloaded in XML format (viewable in a web browser such as Internet Explorer). The URL for downloading is: http://iase.disa.mil/stigs/cci/Pages/index.aspx. DISA encourages feedback from the information security community; a comment form is provided for that purpose. DISA is also in the process of revising numerous Security Technical Implementation Guides (STIGs) to include references to CCIs that correspond to each of the recommended configuration settings.</div>

This minimum standard of security requirements ensures continuity of information protection.

It has been known as the Kennedy–Kassebaum Act or Kassebaum–Kennedy Act after two of its leading sponsors.[1][2] Title I of HIPAA protects health insurance coverage for workers and their families when they change or lose their jobs. Title II of HIPAA, known as the Administrative Simplification (AS) provisions, requires the establishment of national standards for electronic health care transactions and national identifiers for providers, health insurance plans, and employers. Technical Safeguards – controlling access to computer systems and enabling covered entities to protect communications containing PHI transmitted electronically over open networks from being intercepted by anyone other than the intended recipient. Information systems housing PHI must be protected from intrusion. When information flows over open networks, some form of encryption must be used. If closed systems or networks are used, existing access controls are considered sufficient and encryption is optional. Each covered entity is responsible for ensuring that the data within its systems have not been changed or erased in an unauthorized manner. Data corroboration, including the use of check sum, double-keying, message authentication, and digital signature may be used to ensure data integrity. Covered entities must also authenticate entities with which they communicate. Authentication consists of corroborating that an entity is who it claims to be. Examples of corroboration include: password systems, two or three-way handshakes, telephone callback, and token systems. Covered entities must make documentation of their HIPAA practices available to the government to determine compliance. In addition to policies and procedures and access records, information technology documentation should also include a written record of all configuration settings on the components of the network because these components are complex, configurable, and always changing. Documented risk analysis and risk management programs are required. Covered entities must carefully consider the risks of their operations as they implement systems to comply with the act. (The requirement of risk analysis and risk management implies that the act’s security requirements are a minimum standard and places responsibility on covered entities to take all reasonable precautions necessary to prevent PHI from being used for non health purposes.)</div>

The Framework Core is a set of cybersecurity activities, outcomes, and informative references that are common across sectors and critical infrastructure. Elements of the Core provide detailed guidance for developing individual organizational Profiles. Through use of Profiles, the Framework will help an organization to align and prioritize its cybersecurity activities with its business/mission requirements, risk tolerances, and resources. The Tiers provide a mechanism for organizations to view and understand the characteristics of their approach to managing cybersecurity risk, which will help in prioritizing and achieving cybersecurity objectives.</div>

These risks are associated with the federal agencies’ decreased visibility into, understanding of, and control over how the technology that they acquire is developed, integrated and deployed, as well as the processes, procedures, and practices used to ensure the integrity, security, resilience, and quality of the products and services. This publication provides guidance to federal agencies on identifying, assessing, and mitigating ICT supply chain risks at all levels of their organizations. The publication integrates ICT supply chain risk management (SCRM) into federal agency risk management activities by applying a multitiered, SCRM-specific approach, including guidance on assessing supply chain risk and applying mitigation activities.</div>
