<div class="p"><span class="T1"><strong>Executive Summary:</strong></span><span class="de_4AF4BF9DD6"> The Executive Summary option produces the Executive Summary Report. As the name implies, it is designed for an executive level audience. The person receiving the report may hold any title; however, the intent is to provide limited graphical and high-level, summary information that can be understood quickly.</span></div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="de_4AF4BF9DD6">This report is limited to around five or six pages and does not include any detailed information beyond listing the top categories and areas of concern. It includes the textual Executive Summary information available on the </span><a class="local_link" href="executive_summary__overview__and_comments_screen.htm"><span class="de_FE04B87F3C">Executive Summary Screen</span></a><span class="de_4AF4BF9DD6">. It also includes the High Level Assessment Description, which is found on the </span><a class="local_link" href="executive_summary__overview__and_comments_screen.htm"><span class="de_FE04B87F3C">Comments &amp; High Level Description screen</span></a><span class="de_4AF4BF9DD6">. </span></div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="T1"><strong>Site Summary:</strong></span><span class="de_4AF4BF9DD6"> </span>The Site Summary option produces the Site Summary Report. The intended audience for this report is a technical manager or supervisor who is responsible for directing the implementation of the recommendations. The report includes everything in the Executive Report plus additional charts at a more detailed level. It also includes the network diagram and a list of all the questions in the assessment that were not positively answered. An important feature is the ranking of the missed questions. Each question is ranked sequentially from one to the total number of questions.</div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p">The question ranking is determined by a formula that takes into consideration the weighting of each question, the weighting of each category, and the security assurance level (SAL) associated with that question. All questions in CSET have been a<span class="de_4AF4BF9DD6">ssigned a unique weighting relative to one another. The categories have been weighted as well. These assignments were determined by subject matter experts and are based on their recommendations. The SAL that is assigned to a question is also considered in the formula. For example, all other things being equal, if Question A has a SAL of High and Question B has a SAL of Low, then Question B would rank higher in the list than A. The recommended ranking would encourage addressing basic requirements before</span> addressing the more difficult ones.</div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p">The rankings are intended to address the question, “What should I work on first?” It is recommended to start with the question ranked Number 1 and work down the list based on available resources and the cybersecurity plan.</div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="T1"><strong>Detail Report:</strong></span> This option will generate the Site Detail Report. The intended audience for this report is the implementers of change in the organization as it provides the details needed to make the necessary resource allocations and commitments to improve the cybersecurity of the facility or site. </div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="T1"><strong>Security Plan</strong></span>: The Security Plan option produces the Site Cyber Security Plan template. It provides an overview of system security requirements and describes the controls in place or planned to meet those requirements. </div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p">The plan includes several sections found in the Site Summary Report but the bulk of the report is a list of all assessment questions and their answers presented in a control-focused format. Thus, the report provides an overview of the cybersecurity requirements and the status for the facility.</div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="T1"><strong>Discoveries Tear Out Sheets:</strong></span><span class="de_4AF4BF9DD6"> The Discoveries Tear Out Sheets option produces a list of all discoveries identified on specific questions during the assessment. Contacts can be assigned to each discovery record and the printed report will allow for easy distribution of assignments to address each discovery or potential issue. </span></div>
