				<title>Topic: Site Summary Report</title>

	<body>
		<table class="pagetable">
			<tr class="page" style="border-color: #ffffff;">
				<td class="page_area" style="border-color: #ffffff; width: 100%;"><div class="description_on_page"><div class="p h1"><h1>Site Summary Report</h1></div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p">Selecting the Site Summary option produces the Site Summary Report. The intended audience for this report is a technical manager or supervisor who is responsible for directing the implementation of the recommendations. The report includes everything in the Executive Report plus additional charts at a more detailed level. It also includes the network diagram and a list of all the questions in the assessment that were not positively answered. An important feature is the ranking of the missed questions. Each question is ranked sequentially from one to the total number of questions.</div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p">The Site Summary Report provides mostly summary information in the form of a variety of charts; however, it is more detailed than the Executive Summary Report and provides additional charts that the Executive Summary Report does not have.</div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p">The sections of the Site Summary Report are discussed below. </div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="T1"><strong>Title Page:</strong></span> The Title Page includes the assessment name, date, and the name of the principal assessor. </div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="T1"><strong>Disclaimer: </strong></span>The disclaimer describes the limitations for use and legalities of CSET and the report.</div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="T1"><strong>Advisory:</strong></span> The Advisory includes recommendations for using CSET for more than an approach to a robust cybersecurity plan, for the team makeup, and for protecting data. It should be read and followed.</div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="T1"><strong>Site Information:</strong></span> This section displays the text that was entered on the Information screen in the tool. It will display all the data with the appropriate labels.</div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="T1"><strong>Description and Summary:</strong></span> This is identical to the first page of the Executive Summary Report. </div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="T1"><strong>Standards Summary:</strong></span> This page is identical to the page in the Executive Summary Report. </div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="T1"><strong>Standards Compliance:</strong></span> A Standards Compliance bar chart is displayed for every Standard selected in the tool. This chart gives the percent of positive answers (either marked as a Yes or Alternative) as compared with the total number of questions in each category. Unlike the earlier combined Standard Summary, this chart uses the categories that are specific to the Standard. The title on the chart is the short name or abbreviation of the full Standard name.</div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="T1"><strong>Network Diagram:</strong></span> A scaled copy of the network diagram is included in the report. The system scales the diagram to fit on the letter-sized <span class="de_4AF4BF9DD6">(8.5&quot;</span><span class="de_7ECBECEBE5"> ×</span><span class="de_4AF4BF9DD6"> 11&quot;) </span>page. </div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="T1"><strong>Component Analysis: </strong></span>This is the last of the common report pages and is described under the <span class="de_51752156DC">Executive Summary Report</span> section. </div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="T1"><strong>Component Compliance by Subject Area:</strong></span> Like the standards, this chart shows the percentage of combined questions that were positively answered in each subject area. Because the components are not linked to any specific standard, the common categories or subject areas are used.</div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="T1"><strong>Network Findings:</strong></span> This list presents the text of the warnings found by the basic network analysis.</div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="T1"><strong>Security Assurance Level (SAL):</strong></span> The Security Assurance Level page displays the results of answers and selections related to the SAL. It includes any values that were determined in the General SAL or the FIPS 199 SAL processes along with any Standard specific values like those for DoD 8500.2. When Cybersecurity Framework Mode is selected as the assessment mode, this section will be changed to display the Cybersecurity Framework Tier Determination. </div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="T1"><strong>Document Library:</strong></span> The next page shows the document titles and file names of any documents that were added to the assessment by the user. They may have been added in association with specific questions or added through the Document Library screen. </div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="T1"><strong>Ranked Subject Areas:</strong></span> The Ranked Subject Areas section shows the categories or subject areas that need the most attention. This chart is organized so that the worst areas are shown at the top and then ordered to those areas doing best at the bottom. This chart can be helpful in prioritizing what areas to work on first.</div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p">The formula for ranking these areas includes several factors such as a weighting given to each area from subject matter experts combined with the number and level of missed questions in each area.</div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p">The top five areas shown on this chart are used to populate the top categories of concern section of the Executive Summary Report. </div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="T1"><strong>Summary of Ranked Questions:</strong></span> This table includes a list of the questions that were missed presented in ranked order. It makes up the bulk of the report. This list is intended to answer the question, “What do I work on first?” </div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p">The table also presents the SALs applicable to the question. General SALs will be listed for most Standards and network components. They are Low (L), Moderate (M), High (H), and Very High (VH). If a CNSSI Standard is selected, the Confidentiality (C), Integrity (I), and Availability (A) levels will be shown. If DoD Instruction 8500.2 is the selected Standard, the Confidentiality (Conf) and Mission Assurance Category (MAC) levels will be shown. They are: Classified (C), Sensitive (S), and Public (P) for Confidentiality; MAC I, II, and III for Mission Assurance Category.</div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p">For requirements mode, the table lists the name of the Standard and the available security levels.</div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p">The top five questions on this chart are used to populate the top questions of concern section of the Executive Summary Report.</div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p">The format of the table is: </div>

<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="Subtitle"><strong>Answer:</strong></span> Why the question is listed in the table. Usually the question was answered No or left unanswered (blank). Unanswered questions should be reviewed and answered, then the report recreated. </div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="T1"><strong>Ranking:</strong></span> The list is based on a formula that includes the number of missed questions, the weighting given to each of those questions, the weighting assigned to the question category or area, the SAL for the question, and the criticality assignment for a component that was included in the diagram. </div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p">All the parameters are factored together. Each question is ordered in the list from the question the user should work on first at the top to the question or requirement that should be addressed last listed on the bottom.</div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p">The SAL of each question is included in the table which gives the user additional information when prioritizing work. A lower SAL usually means that the fix will be relatively simple. However, while more time consuming and costly to fix, a higher SAL, represents a higher level of protection. Resources should be allocated according to the calculated rank and the risk tolerance of the user. </div>

<div class="p"><span class="T1"><strong>Question Comments/Marked for Review:</strong></span> This section includes all the questions that had comments entered or had the Marked for Review check box clicked.
