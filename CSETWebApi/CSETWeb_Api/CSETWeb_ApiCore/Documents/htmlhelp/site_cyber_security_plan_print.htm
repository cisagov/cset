<div class="p">The Site Cyber Security Plan provides an overview of the security requirements of the system and describes the controls in place or planned, for meeting those requirements. The Security Plan Report is presented in template format with some generic text (distinguished by being in 10 point font and italicized) that must be replaced with verbiage describing the actual site or facility and the assessment results. Sections to replace include:</div>

<div class="p"><span class="T1"><strong>Network Diagram, Zone List, and Inventory List:</strong></span><span class="de_AC2A21CFAA"><strong> </strong></span>The report presents a copy of the network diagram scaled to fit on the letter-sized (8.5&quot; <span class="de_7ECBECEBE5">×</span> 11&quot;) page. It includes a list of the zones that are included in the network diagram if any were identified. The zone information includes the zone name, owner, security level, and the percent implemented. The percent implemented is the number of yes answers per the total number of questions for components in the zone. The report then provides an inventory of all network components that were included in the diagram grouped by zone.</div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="T1"><strong>Security Assurance Level (SAL):</strong></span><span class="de_E71183D815"> </span>The SAL page displays the results of the answers and selections related to the SAL. When Cybersecurity Framework is selected as the Assessment Mode, this section will be changed to display the Cybersecurity Framework Tier Determination.</div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="T1"><strong>Security Plan Controls and Status List</strong></span>: This section lists all the requirements and controls selected during the assessment. The table includes the requirement title, the control description, affected zones and components, if there are any, and the related questions with the answers that were provided during the assessment. A brief description of each field is provided at the start of the section and repeated below.</div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="Subtitle"><strong>Requirement Title:</strong></span><span class="de_FFB638AC42"> </span>Is the control title as it is generally defined in the Standard document from which this control is derived.</div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="Subtitle"><strong>CSET Question/Requirement Category:</strong></span><span class="de_FFB638AC42"> Shows the CSET Question category from the global questions list. Questions from multiple Standards have been consolidated together in the CSET tool and assigned a common category. </span></div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="Subtitle"><strong>Control Level:</strong></span> <span class="de_FFB638AC42">Mapped to one of Low, Moderate, High, or Very High.</span></div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="Subtitle"><strong>Implementation Status: </strong></span><span class="de_FFB638AC42">Shows the percentage complete as the number of yes answers divided by the total related questions for this control. This percentage implemented will not necessarily be reflective of the amount of work required to implement the control but is merely an indicator of how many of the questions related to the control have been addressed so far. </span></div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="Subtitle"><strong>Short Standard Name:</strong></span><span class="de_FFB638AC42"> Is an indicator of which Standard this control is derived. </span></div>

<div class="p"><span class="Subtitle"><strong>Affected Zones:</strong></span><span class="de_FFB638AC42"> Only applicable to controls derived from a</span> diagram. If a diagram was included in the original assessment, this field will contain a list of zones in which at least one component was found to require this control. </div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="Subtitle"><strong>Affected Components:</strong></span><span class="de_FFB638AC42"> This field contains a list of the components that are directly applicable to this control. </span></div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="Subtitle"><strong>Related Questions and Answers:</strong></span><span class="de_FFB638AC42"> A list of the questions and answers from which the implementation status of this control was determined</span>. </div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p">The table is grouped by control, meaning that there may be several questions under each requirement. The table also summarizes the implementation status of each requirement as a percentage of positive answers per number of related questions. It is ordered to match the on-screen display of the control questions so the user can more easily find and review requirements of interest. </div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p">This is the heart of the report. Using this table, the reader can quickly see all the requirements related to the facility and how closely each is being met. </div>

<div class="p"><span class="T1"><strong>Cybersecurity Framework</strong></span></div>
