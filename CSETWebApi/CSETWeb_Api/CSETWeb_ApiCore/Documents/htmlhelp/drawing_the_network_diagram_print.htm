<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="de_4AF4BF9DD6">There are a couple different ways to start drawing a network diagram. The first approach is to use a template. The templates included in the diagram tool are generic for a particular sector or control system type. </span></div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="de_4AF4BF9DD6">When you first begin a new diagram a popup for selecting a template will open. If you want to begin with a template, select from the list. The included template types are: DCS, PCS, SCADA, Electric Utility, Hydroelectric System, Nuclear Plant, Oil &amp; Gas System 1, Oil &amp; Gas System 2, Traffic Control, Waste Water Treatment Plant, Water Plant System, HVAC, Building Access Control, Medical, and Radio.</span></div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="de_4AF4BF9DD6">To select a template</span><span class="de_8441C0A894"><strong> </strong></span><span class="de_4AF4BF9DD6">after starting a diagram, go to the File menu tab and select New from Template.</span><span class="de_8441C0A894"><strong> </strong></span><span class="de_4AF4BF9DD6">Clicking the button will open the same list of templates that opens upon starting a new diagram. When you select a template from the available list, the system will load the components, network connectors, and zones in the diagram. You will need to modify the components and the layout to match your system.</span></div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="de_4AF4BF9DD6">The second approach is to start a diagram from scratch. You do so as follows:</span></div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="de_4AF4BF9DD6">1) Click and drag an ICS component icon from the Symbols panel onto the drawing area. Continue to drag components onto th</span>e diagram until you have placed those that you need.</div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p">2) Add metadata for each icon, such as the label, IP address, criticality, Host Name, and Description. The SAL is inherited from the Zone or overall assessment. Metadata options change based on the shape selected.</div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="de_4AF4BF9DD6">3) Connect the components using line connectors. See the Help section titled </span><a class="local_link" href="adding_links.htm"><span class="de_FE04B87F3C">Adding Links</span></a><span class="de_4AF4BF9DD6"> for more details. </span></div>
<div class="p"><span class="de_4AF4BF9DD6">&#160;</span></div>
<div class="p"><span class="de_4AF4BF9DD6">4) Add zones with the necessary diagram properties, and then move the respective components into the zone boundaries. See the Help section titled </span><a class="local_link" href="adding_zones.htm"><span class="de_FE04B87F3C">Adding Zones</span></a><span class="de_4AF4BF9DD6"> for more information. </span></div>
<div class="p"><span class="de_4AF4BF9DD6">&#160;</span></div>
<div class="p"><span class="de_4AF4BF9DD6">5) Add any labels, shapes, or text to polish the diagram. See the Help sections labeled </span><a class="local_link" href="adding_text.htm"><span class="de_FE04B87F3C">Adding Text</span></a><span class="de_4AF4BF9DD6"> and </span><a class="local_link" href="adding_symbols.htm"><span class="de_FE04B87F3C">Adding Shapes</span></a><span class="de_4AF4BF9DD6"> for more information. </span></div>
<div class="p"><span class="de_4AF4BF9DD6">&#160;</span></div>
<div class="p"><span class="de_4AF4BF9DD6">6) Continue to add to, remove, or edit the icons until the diagram is complete.</span></div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="de_4AF4BF9DD6">7) Use the Save As to download the diagram as a physical file. Use the Export As to export the diagram as a .PNG, .JPEG, .SVG, .VSDX, or use the Advanced Feature to specify the file type, size, background, and border of the file being exported.</span></div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p h2"><h2>Adding Components</h2></div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p">To add a new component icon to the diagram, you will need to select it from the left side Symbols panel. For the following example, adding a component will be discussed. See the image below. The process is similar for adding a shape or zone. </div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="de_4AF4BF9DD6"><img  alt="Placing a component" style="border: solid 0px #000000;  " width="650" height="455" class="de_custom_img de_780D01ADE8" src="drex_drawing_the_network_diagram_custom.png" data-full-src="drex_drawing_the_network_diagram_custom.png" data-full-width="808" data-full-height="533" /></span></div>
<div class="p"><span class="Caption"><strong>Figure: Placing a component</strong></span></div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="de_4AF4BF9DD6">In this example, the user has clicked on the Application Server icon from the Components list and while holding the mouse down, dragged a copy of the icon onto the drawing area. The selected icon is highlighted. While the frame is displayed you can select a corner to change the size of the icon. You can also rotate the icon using the handle shown above. If you click within the box, you can drag the component across the screen. You can also move the selected component by using the keyboard arrows. </span></div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p">Some devices may be physically contained within a single shell such as a firewall and intrusion detection system (IDS). In such a case, a logical combination of the firewall and the IDS icons should be placed on the diagram. Or, the Multiple Services Component may be used to group the device icons. </div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p">Clicking the icon will open the Format panel with diagram properties and formatting options for the symbols on the right side of the screen. </div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><img  alt="Symbol with properties panel open" style="border: solid 0px #000000;  " width="253" height="319" class="de_custom_img de_780D01ADE8" src="drex_drawing_the_network_diagram_custom_2.png" data-full-src="drex_drawing_the_network_diagram_custom_2.png" data-full-width="297" data-full-height="374" /></div>

<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p h2"><h2>Component Options </h2></div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="T1"><strong>Style tab</strong></span></div>
<div class="p">The options under the Style tab include background, border, opacity, edit/copy/paste/set as default, and view the property details.</div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="T1"><strong>Text tab</strong></span></div>
<div class="p">Under the text tab, the attribute of any embedded text can be changed such as the font, the size, position, spacing, and the text color.</div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="T1"><strong>Arrange tab</strong></span></div>
<div class="p">The arrange tab provides the ability to resize, position, rotate, flip, and angle the symbols.</div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="T1"><strong>Property tab</strong></span></div>
<div class="p">Options under the property tab include designations of label, the SAL, IP address, asset type, criticality, unique questions checkbox, a description field and a host name.</div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p h2"><h2>Symbol Properties </h2></div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><a class="anchor" id="label"></a><span class="Subtitle"><strong>Label: </strong></span><span class="de_4AF4BF9DD6">This is the common name used to refer to the component. This name will be used in the Questions screen, the analysis, and the reports. It should be the name that people are most familiar with. While not required, ideally these names should be unique. Examples may be Main Historian, Corp Firewall, Pump House HMI, etc.</span></div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="Subtitle"><strong>SAL:</strong></span> <span class="de_4AF4BF9DD6">This field is only applicable to a zone object and allows you to change the </span><a class="local_link" href="prepare_sal_selection.htm"><span class="de_FE04B87F3C">security assurance level</span></a><span class="de_4AF4BF9DD6"> (SAL) for that specific zone. This can be helpful in separating areas of the facility into those areas that need greater protection and those that do not. </span></div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="de_4AF4BF9DD6">If, for example, you have an overall SAL of High based on the consequences of an event happening at the facility and you do not use zones and do not change the SAL level, then all component questions that are marked as High will be presented. If you changed a particular zone to Low, because it was not included in the critical areas, the question set would be smaller and would be less rigorous than the High questions. The zone approach allows you to minimize costs and use of limited resources, while still providing the appropriate levels of protection for your site.</span></div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><a class="anchor" id="IP_Address"></a><span class="Subtitle"><strong>IP Address:</strong></span><span class="de_4AF4BF9DD6"> This field is only for your reference. It is not used by CSET at this time and is for you to captu</span>re the Internet Protocol addre<span class="de_4AF4BF9DD6">ss information if you wish.</span></div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><a class="anchor" id="Asset_Type"></a><span class="Subtitle"><strong>Asset:</strong></span> This field displays the asset or component type. It is used to help identify the selected component. The type may be modified by using the drop-down selection box. Changing the type will automatically change the icon on the drawing. The Tag will also change to indicate the new type unless it was modified by the user or if the diagram was created in an earlier version of CSET.</div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><a class="anchor" id="Criticality"></a><span class="Subtitle"><strong>Criticality:</strong></span><span class="de_4AF4BF9DD6"> This field allows you to adjust the relative importance of a particular component as compared with others on the diagram. When you place a component on the diagram, the default setting will be moderate. If the component is of lesser importance, then it can be changed to Low. Conversely, if the component is of greater importance to the system, then it should be changed to High. </span></div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="de_4AF4BF9DD6">The level captures the relative importance of unique components in the diagram and can be used in planning, design, and maintenance decisions.</span></div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><a class="anchor" id="Host_Name"></a><span class="Subtitle"><strong>Host:</strong></span><span class="de_4AF4BF9DD6"> This is the official network name for the piece of hardware. Often the organization will keep a database or inventory of assets, including network equipment. The name in the inventory may have a property number that is unique but may not be remembered by most people. An example might be ACME1-43222-AC-22. The Host Name is useful for verification of exact equipment, but is not used elsewhere in CSET at this time. </span></div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><a class="anchor" id="Has_Unique_Questions"></a><span class="Subtitle"><strong>Has Unique Questions:</strong></span><span class="de_4AF4BF9DD6"> This is an important option for identifying a component that is different from other components of that type in the system. By marking a component as being unique, you are instructing the tool to create a separate full set of questions for the device. This means that the default questions that are answered for all components in the system, or even for those of a given type, will not propagate to any component marked as unique.</span></div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="de_4AF4BF9DD6">As an example, you may have five servers in your facility, and four of those have been replaced in the last year with new models. These four are configured with the latest policies and take advantage of features inherent in a new operating system and other improved utilities. The fifth server is several years old and uses technology from an earlier period. In this situation, the fifth server should be marked as unique, so that the answers related to the four new servers are not assigned to the older fifth server.</span></div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p">There are a few components, like the web, that have no questions assigned to them. The Has Unique Questions box will be dim or disabled when no question sets are associated with a particular component. </div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><a class="anchor" id="Description"></a><span class="Subtitle"><strong>Description</strong></span>: This optional field allows the user to add descriptive text about the component. </div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p">If you click on a zone the property tab will show a &quot;type&quot;. It's a dropdown which you can use to change the <a class="local_link" href="adding_zones.htm"><span class="de_2B94C39861">zone type</span></a>.</div>
