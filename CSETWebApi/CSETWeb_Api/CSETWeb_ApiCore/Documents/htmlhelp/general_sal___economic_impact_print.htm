<div class="p"><span class="de_4AF4BF9DD6">The slider bars provide a general range of values for both human and economic impact. The range of values is somewhat broad but allows for a uniform way of measuring the various categories. Review the question and move the slider to the best estimate of the answer.</span></div>

<div class="p"><span class="de_4AF4BF9DD6">Economic impact includes costs because of loss of production, damage or loss of product or feed stock, damage or loss of control system logic (damage to the physical system components should be counted under capital assets), damage or loss of data, costs of lawsuits, etc. </span></div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="de_4AF4BF9DD6">To estimate the cost of production loss, divide the annual budget by 365 (to calculate the daily budget) then multiply by the estimated down time in days. Include an estimate of displacement costs. That is, the estimated cost of working from an alternate, temporary location such as using a rented trailer for administrative functions. The cost of lawsuits with the associated loss of reputation is difficult to estimate. Look to history for the occurrence of similar scenarios for an indication of economic impact. </span></div>
