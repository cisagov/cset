<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="de_4AF4BF9DD6">This section of the user guide describes the network analysis rules found in the network diagram editor. &#160; It may be worthwhile to review these rules as guidelines for a basic network architecture. </span></div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="de_4AF4BF9DD6">Rule 1:&#160; There must be a firewall or other border protection devices (data diode) between different network enclaves (zones).&#160; </span></div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="de_26862E2C77">&quot;The network path identified by the components, {0} and {1}, appears to connect network segments whose components reside in different zones.&#160; A firewall to filter the traffic on this path is recommended to protect the components in one zone from a compromised component in the other zone.&quot;</span><span class="de_4AF4BF9DD6">;</span></div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="de_4AF4BF9DD6"><strong>Additional Description:</strong> The purpose of a network enclave is to limit internal access to a portion of a network. It's necessary when the set of resources differs from those of the general network surroundings.&#160; Typically, network enclaves are not publicly accessible. Internal accessibility is restricted through the use of internal firewalls, VLANs, network access control, and VPNs.&#160; </span></div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="de_4AF4BF9DD6">Segmenting a network into separate enclaves prevents either an internal or external threat attacker from moving freely through the network. &#160; Organizations that implement a secure network design will find that the added cost and complexity of segmentation is more than offset by a reduction in number and severity of incidents.&#160; The effort extended in learning, classifying, and segmenting the network helps your network administrators and architects to better understand the network, both from a performance and security perspective. This adds value and strengthens all of the organization’s controls.</span></div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="de_4AF4BF9DD6">Rule 2:&#160; Firewalls should have an associated IPS or IDS to monitor traffic and confirm firewall configuration.</span></div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="de_26862E2C77">The subnet, “Subnet Name”, should have an IDS (Intrusion Detection System) or IPS (Intrusion Prevention System) inline to confirm that the configuration of firewall, “Firewall Name”, is correct and that malware has not been able to penetrate past the firewall.</span></div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="de_4AF4BF9DD6"><strong>Additional Description: </strong>There are two common types of IDS systems: Host based and Network based.&#160; Host Intrusion Detection Systems(HIDS) are installed on the host and watch network traffic and system information for indicators of intrusion. Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) only monitor network traffic. This rule refers to NIDS. Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) are based on the same principles and techniques as an IDS but adds the additional functionality of responding to network intrusions </span></div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="de_4AF4BF9DD6">Rule 3:&#160; Separating enclaves (zones) strictly by VLANs does not necessarily protect traffic between VLANS. &#160; </span></div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="de_26862E2C77">&quot;The separate subnets handled by the VLAN component, {0}, carry traffic of different SALs.&#160; The incorrect configuration of the component, or the possible compromise of the component, allow the critical traffic to be visible on the less protected network segment.&quot;</span><span class="de_4AF4BF9DD6">;</span></div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="de_4AF4BF9DD6"><strong>Additional Description: </strong>See the following article for additional discussion. </span><a href="https://www.nsa.gov/Portals/70/documents/resources/everyone/csfc/capability-packages/MSCCPv1.1_20180626.pdf"><span class="de_FE04B87F3C">https://www.nsa.gov/Portals/70/documents/resources/everyone/csfc/capability-packages/MSCCPv1.1_20180626.pdf</span></a></div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="de_4AF4BF9DD6">Rule 4: &#160; No multi-homed devices. &#160; Multiple interfaces in a component may acts as a bridge between the different enclaves. </span></div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="de_26862E2C77">&quot;The component, {0}, has multiple interfaces where the subnets of those interfaces carry traffic of different SALs.&#160; If the component is compromised, the critical traffic could be visible from the less protected network.&quot;</span><span class="de_4AF4BF9DD6">;</span></div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="de_4AF4BF9DD6"><strong>Additional Description: </strong>This bridges networks by allowing multi-homed devices to bypass your security controls and allows an attacker to freely pivot from one network to another. A multi-homed device is any device with multiple network cards or interfaces. &#160; </span></div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="de_4AF4BF9DD6">Rule 5: &#160; No backdoor modems or unprotected third-party connections</span></div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="de_26862E2C77">“The path identified by the components, {0} and {1}, appears to connect on one side to an external network.&#160; A firewall to filter the traffic to and from the external network is recommended to protect the facility's network.&#160; Note that a 'Web' component, 'Vendor' component, or 'Partner' component are all assumed to interface with an external network.&#160; In addition, a modem with a single connection is assumed to allow a connection from outside the facility's network.&quot;</span><span class="de_4AF4BF9DD6">;</span></div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="de_4AF4BF9DD6"><strong>Additional Description: </strong>A backdoor connection is a modem or other connection that bypasses all the regular security checks when accessing the system through the regularly recognized means. Attackers find and use these connections to access your system. These backdoor connections should either be eliminated or require the same level of security access and control as any other external connection. </span></div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="de_4AF4BF9DD6">Rule 6: &#160; No open untrusted links.&#160; Either firewall it off or wrap in VPN or Encrypted Tunnel. </span></div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="de_26862E2C77">&quot;The path between the components, {0} and {1}, is untrusted.&#160; Because malicious traffic may be introduced onto the link, a firewall to filter the traffic on both sides of untrusted link is recommended.&quot;</span><span class="de_4AF4BF9DD6">;</span></div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="de_4AF4BF9DD6"><strong>Additional Description: </strong>An untrusted link is any link that may have potential public access. This can be a line that has open physical access, or it can be a connection that crosses the internet unencrypted.&#160; Attackers can use this open access to see the data in the connection or change the information to compromise your system. </span></div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="de_4AF4BF9DD6">Rule 7:&#160; Correct Data Flow on Unidirectional devices. </span></div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="de_26862E2C77">&quot;Data flow between two distinct SAL zones via a unidirectional {0} must only flow from a higher SAL to a lower SAL. Example Control or SCADA network SAL High to Corporate Network SAL Low, but not SAL Low to SAL High.&quot;</span><span class="de_4AF4BF9DD6">;</span></div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="de_26862E2C77">&quot;Data flow between two distinct SAL zones via a unidirectional {0} must only flow from a lower SAL to a higher SAL. Example unclassified network to classified network&quot;</span><span class="de_4AF4BF9DD6">;</span></div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="de_4AF4BF9DD6"><strong>Additional Description: </strong>This one is a little bit more nuanced. When working in a control system or SCADA environment data should be able to flow out of the environment but not in (i.e. availability is important, but confidentiality is unimportant). When working in a data protection environment (e.g. classified) data may flow into the environment but not out. </span></div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="de_5EC8135B83">A <strong>unidirectional network</strong> (also referred to as a <strong>unidirectional gateway</strong> or <strong>data diode</strong>) is a network appliance or device that allows data to travel in only one direction. Data diodes can be found most commonly in high security environments, such as defense, where they serve as connections between two or more networks of differing security classifications. Given the rise of industrial </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things"><span class="de_164D6FD52B">IoT</span></a><span class="de_5EC8135B83"> and </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digitization"><span class="de_164D6FD52B">digitization</span></a><span class="de_5EC8135B83">, this technology can now be found at the industrial control level for such facilities as </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_power_plants"><span class="de_164D6FD52B">nuclear power plants</span></a><span class="de_5EC8135B83">, </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_generation"><span class="de_164D6FD52B">power generation</span></a><span class="de_5EC8135B83"> and </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_critical_systems"><span class="de_164D6FD52B">safety critical systems</span></a><span class="de_5EC8135B83"> like railway networks. </span></div>
