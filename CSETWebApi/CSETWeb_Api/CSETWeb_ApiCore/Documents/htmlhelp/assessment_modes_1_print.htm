<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="de_4AF4BF9DD6">This section provides additional information on the three available advanced assessment modes on the Assessment Mode Selection screen of the CSET tool. </span></div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="T1"><strong>Questions-based Approach:</strong></span><span class="de_4AF4BF9DD6"> </span></div>
<div class="p"><span class="de_4AF4BF9DD6">A comprehensive set of questions has been prepared with straightforward language that encompasses all the topics and requirements found in the major industrial control system (ICS) and information technology (IT) Standards. Each question is written in such a way that it can be answered as either Yes or No. (Questions can also be answered by using alternates or not applicable; however, they do not use multi-part answers.) The full set of questions is filtered and limited by the Standards selected and by the SAL. The Questions mode is recommended for most assessments and is set by default.</span></div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="T1"><strong>Requirements-Based Approach:</strong></span><span class="de_4AF4BF9DD6"> </span></div>
<div class="p"><span class="de_4AF4BF9DD6">The Requirements mode was developed primarily for regulated industries such as nuclear or electrical power. This mode is designed so that the user will see the exact wording of each requirement in the Standard. The question must be read and answered in its entirety. </span></div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p h2"><h2>Questions-based Approach</h2></div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="de_4AF4BF9DD6">If the Questions-based Approach is selected then most of the Standards will be available. Select the Standard or Standards that apply to the system and industry or sector being evaluated. </span></div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="de_4AF4BF9DD6">If only one Standard is selected, the Key Questions offer a small selection of the top set of requirements designed for assessments of limited scope or time while the Universal Questions offer the most comprehensive, general evaluation. </span></div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="de_4AF4BF9DD6">If multiple Standards are selected, the questions will be the superset of all selected Standards. It is recommended that the Universal Questions be included. The Standards may have some questions that are so unique that they are not included in the universal set. This means that selecting both the Universal Questions and a Standard will result in a set of questions that is potentially greater than the Universal Questions themselves. These situations are described in detail below.</span></div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p">In the figure below, three cases are presented. (In 1 and 2, there is no consideration for the SAL.)</div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="de_4AF4BF9DD6"><img  alt="Question sets for questions mode" style="border: solid 0px #000000;  " width="540" height="180" class="de_custom_img de_780D01ADE8" src="drex_assessment_modes_1_custom.png" data-full-src="drex_assessment_modes_1_custom.png" data-full-width="540" data-full-height="180" /></span></div>
<div class="p"><span class="Caption"><strong>Figure: Question sets for questions mode</strong></span></div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="T1"><strong>Case 1.</strong></span><span class="de_4AF4BF9DD6"> In this scenario, only the Universal Questions option has been selected. As shown in the diagram, all the Universal Questions are displayed.</span></div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="T1"><strong>Case 2.</strong></span><span class="de_4AF4BF9DD6"> This scenario shows two options. If only Standard A was selected, then only those questions included in the inner circle would be presented. The Universal Questions outside the inner circle would not be included in the assessment. The second option shows where both Standard A and the Universal Questions were selected. Because the Standard is completely included in the Universal Question set, the resulting assessment questions would look exactly like Case 1, the Universal Question set.</span></div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="T1"><strong>Case 3.</strong></span><span class="de_4AF4BF9DD6"> Unlike the example in Case 2, the selected Standard B has extra questions not found in the Universal Question set. If only<strong> </strong>Standard B was selected then everything shown in the ellipse would be displayed in the assessment. If both the Standard and Universal Questions sets were selected, then the total assessment would be greater than what is included in Case 1 and would include the combination of both the round (Universal) and ellipse (Standard B) shapes. </span></div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p h2"><h2>Requirements-based Approach</h2></div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="de_4AF4BF9DD6">If the Requirements-based Approach is chosen, then the Universal Questions option is disabled. If multiple Standards are selected, then for each choice a completely different set of requirements will be displayed. In </span>the figure below<span class="de_4AF4BF9DD6">, two cases are presented. </span></div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="de_4AF4BF9DD6"><img  alt="Requirements mode" style="border: solid 0px #000000;  " width="540" height="162" class="de_custom_img de_780D01ADE8" src="drex_assessment_modes_1_custom_2.png" data-full-src="drex_assessment_modes_1_custom_2.png" data-full-width="540" data-full-height="162" /></span></div>
<div class="p"><span class="Caption"><strong>Figure: Requirements mode</strong></span></div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="T1"><strong>Case 1</strong></span><span class="de_4AF4BF9DD6"><strong>.</strong> In this scenario, a single Standard has been selected, and only the requirements for Standard A will be presented in the Questions screen.</span></div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="T1"><strong>Case 2.</strong></span><span class="de_4AF4BF9DD6"> This second scenario shows the selection of multiple Standards. No matter how many Standards are selected, the tool will display the full set of requirements for each set regardless of any overlap. Because the wording in the Standard is unique, each requirement will be given verbatim. In the application, the requirements in the Standards will simply show up on the question tree in a sequential manner.</span></div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p h2"><h2>Standards Available in Both Modes </h2></div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p">Many Standards are available in both the Questions mode and the Requirements mode. In Questions mode, statements from the Standard may be split apart to form several questions so that the user may get partial credit for complying with a portion of the requirement. It also makes each question shorter, more direct, and easier to understand. In Requirements mode, the requirement statement is presented as written in the Standard. It may be longer and encompass several compliance activities. Partial compliance is considered a Fail in this mode.</div>
