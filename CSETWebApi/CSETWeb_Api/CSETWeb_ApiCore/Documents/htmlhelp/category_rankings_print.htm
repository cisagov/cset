<div class="p"><span class="de_4AF4BF9DD6">Each Standard has an overall defined risk. This overall risk is determined from the number of questions and the weight of each question. The weights of questions have been determined by cyber security experts. If all questions have been completely failed then the ranked category bar charts will show that the user is at 100% of the risk defined by the Standard as seen in Figure: Ranked Categories with 0%. If about half the questions were answered yes, then the graph would only show the user at 50% of the overall risk as seen in Figure: Ranked Categories with 50%. See the two graphs below.</span></div>

<div class="p"><span class="de_4CD179DA38"><img  alt="Ranked Categories with 50% of account management questions passed" style="border: solid 0px #000000;  " width="378" height="422" class="de_custom_img de_780D01ADE8" src="drex_category_rankings_custom_2.png" data-full-src="drex_category_rankings_custom_2.png" data-full-width="378" data-full-height="422" /></span></div>
<div class="p"><span class="Caption"><strong>Figure: Ranked Categories with 50% of account management questions passed</strong></span></div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="de_4AF4BF9DD6">Note that the x-axis is different between Figures Ranked Categories with 0% and Ranked Categories with 50%. Otherwise the graphs look about the same. The x-axis changes because the proportions of risk are the same. According to this Standard, the Monitoring and Malware controls consume about 2/3 of the risk that Account Management does. However, if we go back and answer a great majority of Account Management questions as Yes then we obtain the chart in Figure: Ranked Categories with 100%.</span></div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="de_4CD179DA38"><img  alt="Ranked Categories with 100% of account management questions passed" style="border: solid 0px #000000;  " width="378" height="422" class="de_custom_img de_780D01ADE8" src="drex_category_rankings_custom_3.png" data-full-src="drex_category_rankings_custom_3.png" data-full-width="378" data-full-height="422" /></span></div>
<div class="p"><span class="Caption"><strong>Figure: Ranked Categories with 100% of account management questions passed</strong></span></div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="de_4AF4BF9DD6">Now the risk accounted for from the Account Management section is only about 1% of the original risk defined by this Standard. Note that Monitoring and Malware still Accounts for about 6% of the overall risk as it did above.</span></div>
