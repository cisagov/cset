<div class="p">Each question in the assessment where the answer had a No response or was unanswered will be ranked and displayed on the Control Priorities Screen. The information provided is intended to answer the fundamental question, &quot;Okay, I have some problems, so what do I do first?&quot; Based on the ranking, the answer would be, do Number 1 first, and then do Number 2, and so on until all resources have been exhausted or all the problems have been resolved. </div>

<div class="p de_0711D341CE">The Control Priorities list displays a list of all questions that were answered 'No' or left unanswered.&#160; The following is a description of the columns in the Control Priorities List:</div>
<div class="p de_0711D341CE">&#160;</div>
<div class="p de_0711D341CE"><span class="T1"><strong>Rank:</strong></span></div>
<div class="p de_0711D341CE">A numeric ranking of each question that was missed with #1 having the highest priority. </div>
<div class="p de_0711D341CE">&#160;</div>
<div class="p de_0711D341CE">The ranking is based on a combination of factors that all impact the overall score. The factors include the following: </div>
<div class="p de_0711D341CE">&#160;</div>
<div class="p de_381126D56C"><span class="Subtitle"><strong>The specific weighting value assigned to each question in CSET.</strong></span> This weighting comes from subject matter experts with years of experience in information technology and control system cybersecurity. The questions were analyzed and assigned a weight relative to all other questions.</div>
<div class="p de_381126D56C">&#160;</div>
<div class="p de_381126D56C"><span class="Subtitle"><strong>The weighting value of the subject area or question category.</strong></span> Each area was also given a weight by experts relative to all other areas. Like the question itself, it was determined that some areas are more important than others, even though they are all important to cybersecurity.</div>
<div class="p de_381126D56C">&#160;</div>
<div class="p de_381126D56C"><span class="Subtitle"><strong>The security assurance level (SAL) of the question.</strong></span> Each question is linked to an assurance level. For example, a question that is associated with a Very High level would be lower in rank than one with a Low level, because it is recommended that the user work on the basic requirements before moving to those required for a higher level. A good example relates to access control. Users should implement a complex password, (or maybe even a password) before worrying about implementing system access controlled by a combination of a complex password, physical token, and biometrics. The SAL will only affect the weighting when the score is higher than a Low for the facility. Because the SAL limits the questions to only those matching the SAL value, if the score is at a Low, then the user would never see any questions that might be marked as Moderate, High, or Very High.</div>
<div class="p de_381126D56C">&#160;</div>
<div class="p de_381126D56C"><span class="Subtitle"><strong>The component criticality value assigned by the user.</strong></span><span class="de_4AF4BF9DD6"> In the network diagram, it is possible to change the criticality of a component from the default of Moderate to either Low or High. Those components that are most critical to the enterprise will be given priority over those that are less critical.</span></div>
<div class="p de_0711D341CE">&#160;</div>
<div class="p de_0711D341CE"><span class="T1"><strong>Standard Name:</strong></span></div>
<div class="p de_0711D341CE">The value in this column identifies the Standard from which the question came. This concept is especially important when using multiple Standards that have the same category names. The combination of Standard Name, Category, and # will help locate the exact question or requirement. </div>
<div class="p de_0711D341CE">&#160;</div>
<div class="p de_0711D341CE"><span class="T1"><strong>Category:</strong></span></div>
<div class="p de_0711D341CE">The title of the main question category or subject area where the question or requirement is found. </div>
<div class="p de_0711D341CE">&#160;</div>
<div class="p de_0711D341CE"><span class="T1"><strong>Number or #:</strong></span></div>
<div class="p de_0711D341CE">This column identifies the question number in the Standard and category. The content is a hyperlink that when clicked, will open the Question screen and navigate to that question. The number will be the requirement title when in the requirements assessment mode.</div>
<div class="p de_0711D341CE">&#160;</div>
<div class="p de_0711D341CE"><span class="T1"><strong>Question:</strong></span> </div>
<div class="p de_0711D341CE">The text from the question or the requirement, depending on which mode was selected. </div>
<div class="p de_0711D341CE">&#160;</div>
<div class="p de_0711D341CE"><span class="T1"><strong>Answer: </strong></span></div>
<div class="p de_0711D341CE">This is the answer selected when completing the assessment.</div>
<div class="p de_0711D341CE">&#160;</div>
<div class="p de_0711D341CE">The data can be sorted by clicking its corresponding column header but it is recommended to keep the questions in Ranked order and address them accordingly. </div>
