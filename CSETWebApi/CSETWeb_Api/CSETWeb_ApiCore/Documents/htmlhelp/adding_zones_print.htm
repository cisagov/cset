<div class="p"><span class="de_4AF4BF9DD6">A zone is a visual representation on the diagram of a physical or logical boundary separating different functional areas. It could also be used to represent systems that are bordered by physical structures such as a fence, building, rooms in a building, or even a plant. A common example is the separation of a corporate information system and an industrial control system (ICS). These two networks could be miles apart or all located at the same facility.</span></div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="de_4AF4BF9DD6">The advantage to using zones is that you are able to provide the appropriate level of security for both the highly critical areas and those that have little consequence. An area in the plant that has very high risk may be secured to a level of Very High, while much of the plant or organization may be at a Moderate or even Low level. This can be helpful when resources are limited, and you need to know where to spend your time, energy, and budget.</span></div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="de_4AF4BF9DD6">To create a zone in CSET, you will need to click the Zones pane on the S</span>ymbols panel. </div>

<div class="p">Drag a zone onto the drawing area. The zone will be initially placed as a blank rectangle. Drag the corners of the zone to include the desired components. If in doubt, place the zone first then add the components and links. The zone will expand to accommodate newly placed components that are at least halfway into the zoned area.</div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p">Moving a zone and dropping it onto an existing component will cause that component to become part of the zone and move with it. Components already assigned to another zone may be incorporated in this way. Caution must be used because unwanted components can be captured and inadvertently included in the wrong zone. It is recommended that components be added individually to zones, rather than collecting them by dragging and dropping the zone onto them. </div>
