					<div class="p">The Cyber Security Evaluation Tool (CSET<sup>®</sup>) is a software tool for
						performing cybersecurity assessments of an organization's enterprise and industrial control
						cyber systems. It was designed to help asset owners identify vulnerabilities and improve the
						organization’s overall cybersecurity posture by guiding them through a series of questions that
						represent network security requirements and best practices. The presented requirement
						questionnaires are based on selected industry Standards, common requirements, and the network
						diagram (or network topology and architecture).&#160; </div>

					</div>
					<div class="p">&#160;</div>
					<div class="p"><span class="T1"><strong>Form the Assessment Team</strong></span></div>
					<div class="p">&#160;</div>
					<div class="p">Prior to beginning the assessment, form a subject matter expert team. Teams typically
						include representation from senior management, business, operations, IT,<span
							class="de_51752156DC"> ICS,</span> and security. The assembled team is responsible for
						determining the evaluation levels and answering specific, detailed questions on the control
						system and security configuration.</div>
					<div class="p">&#160;</div>
					<div class="p">Familiarity with the tool will improve and speed up the assessment process. Anyone in
						the organization who has had training or experience with the tool should be included on the
						team. Alternately, the primary user should spend some time using the tool with test-only or
						dummy data prior to commencement of the team activity.</div>
					<div class="p">&#160;</div>
					<div class="p">Documents that may be referenced should be gathered prior to the assessment. Useful
						reference materials include information relating to operations, maintenance, physical security,
						cybersecurity, and hazardous materials.</div>
					<div class="p">&#160;</div>
					<div class="p"><span class="T1"><strong>Launch CSET</strong></span></div>

					<div class="p"><span class="de_4AF4BF9DD6">CSET provides a versatile diagramming tool to create a

							enhance the visual presentation, allow grouping and layers, and provide input to the
							analysis and question ranking. Simple network analysis is available within the tool and is

					<div class="p"><span class="de_4AF4BF9DD6">After the user builds the network diagram, CSET generates

					<div class="p">&#160;</div>
					<div class="p"><span class="Subtitle"><strong>Analysis</strong></span></div>
					<div class="p"><span class="de_4AF4BF9DD6">Assessment results can be reviewed in two locations: the
