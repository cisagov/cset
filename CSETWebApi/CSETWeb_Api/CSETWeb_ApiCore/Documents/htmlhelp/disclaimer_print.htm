The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) does not provide any warranties of any kind regarding any information contained within. In no event shall the United States Government or its contractors or subcontractors be liable for any damages, including but not limited to, direct, indirect, special, or consequential damages and including damages based on any negligence of the United States Government or its contractors or subcontractors, arising out of, resulting from, or in any way connected with this report, whether based on warranty, contract, tort, or otherwise, whether injury was sustained from, or arose out of the results of, or reliance upon the report.&quot;</div>

<div class="p" style="text-align: left; direction: ltr; margin-left: 0px; text-indent: 0px;">&quot;DHS does not endorse any commercial product or service, including the subject of the assessment or evaluation in this report. Any reference to specific commercial products, processes, or services by trademark, manufacturer, or otherwise, does not constitute or imply its endorsement, recommendation, or favoring by DHS.&quot;</div>

<div class="p" style="text-align: left; direction: ltr; margin-left: 0px; text-indent: 0px;">&quot;The display of the DHS official seal or other DHS visual identities on this report shall not be interpreted to provide the recipient organization authorization to use the official seal, insignia or other visual identities of DHS. The DHS seal, insignia, or other visual identities shall not be used in any manner to imply endorsement of any commercial product or activity by DHS or the United States Government. Use of the DHS seal without proper authorization violates federal law (e.g., 18 U.S.C. §§ 506, 701, 1017) and is against DHS policies governing usage of the seal.&quot;</div>
