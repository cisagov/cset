        <strong>Introduction </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        This automated approach uses key portions of the Federal Information
        Processing Standards (FIPS) Publication 199 and National Institute of
        Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-60 to help
        determine the overall security level of the system being evaluated. The
        standards and guidelines from FIPS 199 and NIST SP 800-60 were prepared for
        use by federal agencies but are applicable to all sectors.
    </p>
    <p>
        The identification of information processed on an information system is
        essential to the proper selection of security controls and ensuring the
        confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system and its
        information. Appropriate levels of control will result in information
        protection that neither overprotects and wastes valuable resources nor
        under protects placing mission-critical information at risk for compromise.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Methodology and Definitions </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        FIPS 199 assigns impact levels (low, moderate, and high) to the identified
        security categories (confidentiality, integrity, and availability) for both
        information and information systems. The assigned impact levels are based
        on the potential impact should certain events occur that jeopardize the
        information or the systems needed to accomplish the organization’s assigned
        mission, protect its assets, fulfill its legal responsibilities, maintain
        day to day operations, and protect individuals.
    </p>
    <p>
        The three security objectives are defined as:
    </p>
    <p>
        CONFIDENTIALITY - A loss of confidentiality is the unauthorized disclosure
        of information.
    </p>
    <p>
        INTEGRITY - A loss of integrity is the unauthorized modification or
        destruction of information.
    </p>
    <p>
        AVAILABILITY - A loss of availability is the disruption of access to or use
        of information or an information system.
    </p>
    <p>
        The three levels of potential impact are defined as:
    </p>
    <p>
        LOW - The loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability could be
        expected to have a limited adverse effect on organizational operations,
        organizational assets, or individuals.
    </p>
    <p>
        MODERATE - The loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability could be
        expected to have a serious adverse effect on organizational operations,
        organizational assets, or individuals.
    </p>
    <p>
        HIGH - The loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability could be
        expected to have a severe or catastrophic adverse effect on organizational
        operations, organizational assets, or individuals.
    </p>
    <p>
        CSET also provides a Very High level for those cases where all controls and
        all optional security enhancements discussed in the special publication are
        included in the system.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Process </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        There are three steps in CSET for determining the overall impact level: 1)
        Select Information Types, 2) Answer questions, and 3) Determine Special
        Factors.
    </p>
    <p>
        1) Select Information Types
    </p>
    <p>
        The first step in this process is to select, from the list provided, one or
        more information types based on the information that is stored, processed,
        input, or output from the systems under consideration. The selection should
        be limited to one or more “primary” information types. CSET will then
        populate the security objectives with the assigned levels.
    </p>
    <p>
        As an example, for the information type “Energy Resource Management” the
        level assignment is:
    </p>
    <p>
        Confidentiality =&gt; Moderate
    </p>
    <p>
        Integrity =&gt; Low
    </p>
    <p>
        Availability =&gt; Low
    </p>
    <p>
        If more than one type is selected, then the level in each category is the
        highest of the aggregation. For example, if three information types are
        selected and the assignments in the integrity category are low, moderate,
        high, then the overall assignment for integrity is high.
    </p>
    <p>
        2) Answer Questions
    </p>
    <p>
        The second step is to answer a short set of questions that applies to the
        information system in general. An affirmative answer to these questions
        will result in an increase in the security level in one or more of the
        security objectives.
    </p>
    <p>
        3) Determine Special Factors
    </p>
    <p>
        Special factors are exceptions to provisional impact assignments by
        information type. If a special factor is available for a selected
        information type, the impact level will be displayed in blue. Clicking on
        the blue link will populate the regulatory text in the special factors box.
        The text should be carefully reviewed and edited to reflect the actual
        system under consideration.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once the three steps have been completed, the user can review and adjust
        the recommended impact level for each of the three security objectives to
        best reflect the unique circumstances associated with the subject system.
