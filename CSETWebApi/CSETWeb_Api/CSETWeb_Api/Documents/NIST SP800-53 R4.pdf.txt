Reports on Computer Systems Technology 
The Information Technology Laboratory (ITL) at the National Institute of Standards and 
Technology (NIST) promotes the U.S. economy and public welfare by providing technical 
leadership for the Nation’s measurement and standards infrastructure. ITL develops tests, test 
methods, reference data, proof of concept implementations, and technical analyses to advance the 
development and productive use of information technology. ITL’s responsibilities include the 
development of management, administrative, technical, and physical standards and guidelines for 
the cost-effective security and privacy of other than national security-related information in 
federal information systems. The Special Publication 800-series reports on ITL’s research, 
guidelines, and outreach efforts in information system security, and its collaborative activities 
with industry, government, and academic organizations. 
 
Abstract 
This publication provides a catalog of security and privacy controls for federal information 
systems and organizations and a process for selecting controls to protect organizational operations 
(including mission, functions, image, and reputation), organizational assets, individuals, other 
organizations, and the Nation from a diverse set of threats including hostile cyber attacks, natural 
disasters, structural failures, and human errors (both intentional and unintentional). The security 
and privacy controls are customizable and implemented as part of an organization-wide process 
that manages information security and privacy risk. The controls address a diverse set of security 
and privacy requirements across the federal government and critical infrastructure, derived from 
legislation, Executive Orders, policies, directives, regulations, standards, and/or mission/business 
needs. The publication also describes how to develop specialized sets of controls, or overlays, 
tailored for specific types of missions/business functions, technologies, or environments of 
operation. Finally, the catalog of security controls addresses security from both a functionality 
perspective (the strength of security functions and mechanisms provided) and an assurance 
perspective (the measures of confidence in the implemented security capability). Addressing both 
security functionality and security assurance ensures that information technology products and 
the information systems built from those products using sound systems and security engineering 
principles are sufficiently trustworthy.

FIPS 200 AND SP 800-53 
IMPLEMENTING INFORMATION SECURITY STANDARDS AND GUIDELINES 
FIPS Publication 200, Minimum Security Requirements for Federal Information and Information 
Systems, is a mandatory federal standard developed by NIST in response to FISMA. To comply 
with the federal standard, organizations first determine the security category of their information 
system in accordance with FIPS Publication 199, Standards for Security Categorization of Federal 
Information and Information Systems, derive the information system impact level from the security 
category in accordance with FIPS 200, and then apply the appropriately tailored set of baseline 
security controls in NIST Special Publication 800-53, Security and Privacy Controls for Federal 
Information Systems and Organizations. Organizations have flexibility in applying the baseline 
security controls in accordance with the guidance provided in Special Publication 800-53. This 
allows organizations to tailor the relevant security control baseline so that it more closely aligns 
with their mission and business requirements and environments of operation. 
FIPS 200 and NIST Special Publication 800-53, in combination, ensure that appropriate security 
requirements and security controls are applied to all federal information and information systems. 
An organizational assessment of risk validates the initial security control selection and determines if 
additional controls are needed to protect organizational operations (including mission, functions, 
image, or reputation), organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, or the Nation. The 
resulting set of security controls establishes a level of security due diligence for the organization.

DEVELOPING COMMON INFORMATION SECURITY FOUNDATIONS 
COLLABORATION AMONG PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTOR ENTITIES 
In developing standards and guidelines required by FISMA, NIST consults with other federal 
agencies and the private sector to improve information security, avoid unnecessary and costly 
duplication of effort, and ensure that its publications are complementary with the standards and 
guidelines employed for the protection of national security systems. In addition to a comprehensive 
public review and vetting process, NIST is collaborating with the Office of the Director of National 
Intelligence (ODNI), the Department of Defense (DoD), and the Committee on National Security 
Systems (CNSS) to establish a unified information security framework for the federal government. 
A common foundation for information security will provide the Civil, Defense, and Intelligence 
sectors of the federal government and their contractors, more cost-effective and consistent ways to 
manage information security-related risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other 
organizations, and the Nation. The unified framework will also provide a strong basis for reciprocal 
acceptance of authorization decisions and facilitate information sharing. NIST is also working with 
many public and private sector entities to establish mappings and relationships between the security 
standards and guidelines developed by NIST and the International Organization for Standardization 
and International Electrotechnical Commission (ISO/IEC).

SECURITY REQUIREMENTS 
FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES OF INTEREST 
The term security requirement is used by different communities and groups in different ways and 
may require additional explanation to establish the particular context for the various use cases. 
Security requirements can be stated at a very high level of abstraction, for example, in legislation, 
Executive Orders, directives, policies, standards, and mission/business needs statements. FISMA 
and FIPS Publication 200 articulate security requirements at such a level. 
Acquisition personnel develop security requirements for contracting purposes that address the 
protections necessary to achieve mission/business needs. Systems/security engineers, system 
developers, and systems integrators develop the security design requirements for the information 
system, develop the system security architecture and the architecture-specific derived security 
requirements, and subsequently implement specific security functions at the hardware, software, 
and firmware component level. 
Security requirements are also reflected in various nontechnical security controls that address such 
matters as policy and procedures at the management and operational elements within organizations, 
again at differing levels of detail. It is important to define the context for each use of the term 
security requirement so the respective communities (including individuals responsible for policy, 
architecture, acquisition, engineering, and mission/business protection) can clearly communicate 
their intent. 
Organizations may define certain security capabilities needed to satisfy security requirements and 
provide appropriate mission and business protection. Security capabilities are typically defined by 
bringing together a specific set of safeguards/countermeasures (i.e., security controls) derived from 
the appropriately tailored baselines that together produce the needed capability.

  TECHNOLOGY AND POLICY NEUTRALITY 
CHARACTERISTICS OF SECURITY CONTROLS 
The security controls in the catalog with few exceptions, have been designed to be policy- and 
technology-neutral. This means that security controls and control enhancements focus on the 
fundamental safeguards and countermeasures necessary to protect information during processing, 
while in storage, and during transmission. Therefore, it is beyond the scope of this publication to 
provide guidance on the application of security controls to specific technologies, environments of 
operation, communities of interest, or missions/business functions. Application-specific areas are 
addressed by the use of the tailoring process described in Chapter Three and the use of overlays 
described in Appendix I. It should also be noted that while the security controls are largely policy- 
and technology-neutral, that does not imply that the controls are policy- and technology-unaware. 
Understanding policy and technology is necessary so that the controls are meaningful and relevant 
when implemented. 
In the few cases where specific technologies are called out in security controls (e.g., mobile, PKI, 
wireless, VOIP), organizations are cautioned that the need to provide adequate security goes well 
beyond the requirements in a single control associated with a particular technology. Many of the 
needed safeguards and countermeasures are obtained from the other security controls in the catalog 
allocated to the initial control baselines as starting points for the development of security plans and 
overlays using the tailoring process. There may also be some overlap in the protections articulated 
by the security controls within the different control families. 
In addition to the customer-driven development of specialized security plans and overlays, NIST 
Special Publications and Interagency Reports may provide guidance on recommended security 
controls for specific technologies and sector-specific applications (e.g., Smart Grid, healthcare, 
Industrial Control Systems, and mobile). 
Employing a technology- and policy-neutral security control catalog has the following benefits: 
• It encourages organizations to focus on the security capabilities required for mission/business 
success and the protection of information, irrespective of the information technologies that are 
employed in organizational information systems. 
• It encourages organizations to analyze each security control for its applicability to specific 
technologies, environments of operation, missions/business functions, and communities of interest. 
• It encourages organizations to specify security policies as part of the tailoring process for security 
controls that have variable parameters. 
The specialization of security plans using the tailoring guidance and overlays, together with a robust 
set of technology- and policy-neutral security controls, promotes cost-effective, risk-based 
information security for organizations—in any sector, for any technology, and in any operating 
environment.

INFORMATION SECURITY DUE DILIGENCE 
MANAGING THE RISK TO ORGANIZATIONAL MISSIONS/BUSINESS FUNCTIONS  
The security controls in NIST Special Publication 800-53 are designed to facilitate compliance with 
applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance. 
Compliance is not about adhering to static checklists or generating unnecessary FISMA reporting 
paperwork. Rather, compliance necessitates organizations executing due diligence with regard to 
information security and risk management. Information security due diligence includes using all 
appropriate information as part of an organization-wide risk management program to effectively 
use the tailoring guidance and inherent flexibility in NIST publications so that the selected security 
controls documented in organizational security plans meet the mission and business requirements of 
organizations. Using the risk management tools and techniques that are available to organizations is 
essential in developing, implementing, and maintaining the safeguards and countermeasures with 
the necessary and sufficient strength of mechanism to address the current threats to organizational 
operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation. Employing effective risk-
based processes, procedures, and technologies will help ensure that all federal information systems 
and organizations have the necessary resilience to support ongoing federal responsibilities, critical 
infrastructure applications, and continuity of government.

PRIVACY CONTROLS 
PROVIDING PRIVACY PROTECTION FOR FEDERAL INFORMATION 
Appendix J, Privacy Control Catalog, is a new addition to NIST Special Publication 800-53. It is 
intended to address the privacy needs of federal agencies. The Privacy Appendix: 
• Provides a structured set of privacy controls, based on best practices, that help organizations 
comply with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, instructions, regulations, 
policies, standards, guidance, and organization-specific issuances; 
• Establishes a linkage and relationship between privacy and security controls for purposes of 
enforcing respective privacy and security requirements which may overlap in concept and in 
implementation within federal information systems, programs, and organizations; 
• Demonstrates the applicability of the NIST Risk Management Framework in the selection, 
implementation, assessment, and ongoing monitoring of privacy controls deployed in federal 
information systems, programs, and organizations; and 
• Promotes closer cooperation between privacy and security officials within the federal 
government to help achieve the objectives of senior leaders/executives in enforcing the 
requirements in federal privacy legislation, policies, regulations, directives, standards, and 
guidance. 
There is a strong similarity in the structure of the privacy controls in Appendix J and the security 
controls in Appendices F and G. For example, the control AR-1 (Governance and Privacy Program) 
requires organizations to develop privacy plans that can be implemented at the organizational or 
program level. These plans can also be used in conjunction with security plans to provide an 
opportunity for organizations to select the appropriate set of security and privacy controls in 
accordance with organizational mission/business requirements and the environments in which the 
organizations operate. Incorporating the same concepts used in managing information security risk, 
helps organizations implement privacy controls in a more cost-effective, risked-based manner while 
simultaneously protecting individual privacy and meeting compliance requirements. Standardized 
privacy controls provide a more disciplined and structured approach for satisfying federal privacy 
requirements and demonstrating compliance to those requirements.

CAUTIONARY NOTE 
IMPLEMENTING CHANGES BASED ON REVISIONS TO SPECIAL PUBLICATION 800-53 
When NIST publishes revisions to Special Publication 800-53, there are four primary types of 
changes made to the document: (i) security controls or control enhancements are added to or 
withdrawn from Appendices F and G and/or to the low, moderate, and high baselines; (ii) 
supplemental guidance is modified; (iii) material in the main chapters or appendices is modified; 
and (iv) language is clarified and/or updated throughout the document. 
When modifying existing tailored security control baselines at Tier 3 in the risk management 
hierarchy (as described in Special Publication 800-39) and updating security controls at any tier as a 
result of Special Publication 800-53 revisions, organizations should take a measured, risk-based 
approach in accordance with organizational risk tolerance and current risk assessments. Unless 
otherwise directed by OMB policy, the following activities are recommended to implement changes 
to Special Publication 800-53: 
• First, organizations determine if any added security controls/control enhancements are 
applicable to organizational information systems or environments of operation following 
tailoring guidelines in this publication. 
• Next, organizations review changes to the supplemental guidance, guidance in the main chapters 
and appendices, and updated/clarified language throughout the publication to determine if 
changes apply to any organizational information systems and if any immediate actions are 
required. 
• Finally, once organizations have determined the entirety of changes necessitated by the 
revisions to the publication, the changes are integrated into the established continuous 
monitoring process to the greatest extent possible. The implementation of new or modified 
security controls to address specific, active threats is always the highest priority for sequencing 
and implementing changes. Modifications such as changes to templates or minor language 
changes in policy or procedures are generally the lowest priority and are made in conjunction 
with established review cycles.

Foreword 
NIST Special Publication 800-53, Revision 4, represents the most comprehensive update to the 
security controls catalog since its inception in 2005. The publication was developed by NIST, the 
Department of Defense, the Intelligence Community, and the Committee on National Security 
Systems as part of the Joint Task Force, an interagency partnership formed in 2009. This update 
was motivated principally by the expanding threat space—characterized by the increasing 
sophistication of cyber attacks and the operations tempo of adversaries (i.e., the frequency of such 
attacks, the professionalism of the attackers, and the persistence of targeting by attackers). State-
of-the-practice security controls and control enhancements have been developed and integrated 
into the catalog addressing such areas as: mobile and cloud computing; applications security; 
trustworthiness, assurance, and resiliency of information systems; insider threat; supply chain 
security; and the advanced persistent threat. In addition, Special Publication 800-53 has been 
expanded to include eight new families of privacy controls based on the internationally accepted 
Fair Information Practice Principles. 
Special Publication 800-53, Revision 4, provides a more holistic approach to information security 
and risk management by providing organizations with the breadth and depth of security controls 
necessary to fundamentally strengthen their information systems and the environments in which 
those systems operate—contributing to systems that are more resilient in the face of cyber attacks 
and other threats. This “Build It Right” strategy is coupled with a variety of security controls for 
“Continuous Monitoring” to give organizations near real-time information that is essential for 
senior leaders making ongoing risk-based decisions affecting their critical missions and business 
functions. 
To take advantage of the expanded set of security and privacy controls, and to give organizations 
greater flexibility and agility in defending their information systems, the concept of overlays was 
introduced in this revision. Overlays provide a structured approach to help organizations tailor 
security control baselines and develop specialized security plans that can be applied to specific 
missions/business functions, environments of operation, and/or technologies. This specialization 
approach is important as the number of threat-driven controls and control enhancements in the 
catalog increases and organizations develop risk management strategies to address their specific 
protection needs within defined risk tolerances. 
Finally, there have been several new features added to this revision to facilitate ease of use by 
organizations. These include:  
• Assumptions relating to security control baseline development; 
• Expanded, updated, and streamlined tailoring guidance; 
• Additional assignment and selection statement options for security and privacy controls; 
• Descriptive names for security and privacy control enhancements; 
• Consolidated tables for security controls and control enhancements by family with 
baseline allocations; 
• Tables for security controls that support development, evaluation, and operational 
assurance; and 
• Mapping tables for international security standard ISO/IEC 15408 (Common Criteria).

The security and privacy controls in Special Publication 800-53, Revision 4, have been designed 
to be largely policy/technology-neutral to facilitate flexibility in implementation. The controls are 
well positioned to support the integration of information security and privacy into organizational 
processes including enterprise architecture, systems engineering, system development life cycle, 
and acquisition/procurement. Successful integration of security and privacy controls into ongoing 
organizational processes will demonstrate a greater maturity of security and privacy programs and 
provide a tighter coupling of security and privacy investments to core organizational missions and 
business functions.

CHAPTER ONE 
INTRODUCTION 
THE NEED TO PROTECT INFORMATION AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS 
he selection and implementation of security controls for information systems1 and 
organizations are important tasks that can have major implications on the operations2 and 
assets of organizations3 as well as the welfare of individuals and the Nation. Security 
controls are the safeguards/countermeasures prescribed for information systems or organizations 
that are designed to: (i) protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information that is 
processed, stored, and transmitted by those systems/organizations; and (ii) satisfy a set of defined 
security requirements.4 There are several key questions that should be answered by organizations 
when addressing the information security considerations for information systems: 
• What security controls are needed to satisfy the security requirements and to adequately 
mitigate risk incurred by using information and information systems in the execution of 
organizational missions and business functions? 
• Have the security controls been implemented, or is there an implementation plan in place? 
• What is the desired or required level of assurance that the selected security controls, as 
implemented, are effective in their application? 5  
The answers to these questions are not given in isolation but rather in the context of an effective 
risk management process for the organization that identifies, mitigates as deemed necessary, and 
monitors on an ongoing basis, risks6 arising from its information and information systems. NIST 
Special Publication 800-39 provides guidance on managing information security risk at three 
distinct tiers—the organization level, mission/business process level, and information system 
level. The security controls defined in this publication and recommended for use by organizations 
to satisfy their information security requirements should be employed as part of a well-defined 
risk management process that supports organizational information security programs.7 
                                                 
1 An information system is a discrete set of information resources organized expressly for the collection, processing, 
maintenance, use, sharing, dissemination, or disposition of information. Information systems also include specialized 
systems such as industrial/process controls systems, telephone switching/private branch exchange (PBX) systems, and 
environmental control systems. 
2 Organizational operations include mission, functions, image, and reputation. 
3 The term organization describes an entity of any size, complexity, or positioning within an organizational structure 
(e.g., a federal agency or, as appropriate, any of its operational elements). 
4 Security requirements are derived from mission/business needs, laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, 
policies, instructions, standards, guidance, and/or procedures to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of 
the information being processed, stored, or transmitted by organizational information systems. 
5 Security control effectiveness addresses the extent to which the controls are implemented correctly, operating as 
intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting the security requirements for the information 
system in its operational environment or enforcing/mediating established security policies. 
6 Information security-related risks are those risks that arise from the loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability of 
information or information systems and consider the potential adverse impacts to organizational operations and assets, 
individuals, other organizations, and the Nation. 
7 The program management controls (Appendix G) complement the security controls for an information system 
(Appendix F) by focusing on the organization-wide information security requirements that are independent of any 
particular information system and are essential for managing information security programs.

CHAPTER 1  PAGE 2 
It is of paramount importance that responsible officials understand the risks and other factors that 
could adversely affect organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and 
the Nation.8 These officials must also understand the current status of their security programs and 
the security controls planned or in place to protect their information and information systems in 
order to make informed judgments and investments that mitigate risks to an acceptable level. The 
ultimate objective is to conduct the day-to-day operations of the organization and accomplish the 
organization’s stated missions and business functions with what the OMB Circular A-130 defines 
as adequate security, or security commensurate with risk resulting from the unauthorized access, 
use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction of information. 
1.1   PURPOSE AND APPLICABILITY 
The purpose of this publication is to provide guidelines for selecting and specifying security 
controls for organizations and information systems supporting the executive agencies of the 
federal government to meet the requirements of FIPS Publication 200, Minimum Security 
Requirements for Federal Information and Information Systems. The guidelines apply to all 
components9 of an information system that process, store, or transmit federal information. The 
guidelines have been developed to achieve more secure information systems and effective risk 
management within the federal government by: 
• Facilitating a more consistent, comparable, and repeatable approach for selecting and 
specifying security controls for information systems and organizations; 
• Providing a stable, yet flexible catalog of security controls to meet current information 
protection needs and the demands of future protection needs based on changing threats, 
requirements, and technologies; 
• Providing a recommendation for security controls for information systems categorized in 
accordance with FIPS Publication 199, Standards for Security Categorization of Federal 
Information and Information Systems; 
• Creating a foundation for the development of assessment methods and procedures for 
determining security control effectiveness; and 
• Improving communication among organizations by providing a common lexicon that 
supports discussion of risk management concepts. 
In addition to the security controls described above, this publication: (i) provides a set of 
information security program management (PM) controls that are typically implemented at the 
organization level and not directed at individual organizational information systems; (ii) 
provides a set of privacy controls based on international standards and best practices that help 
organizations enforce privacy requirements derived from federal legislation, directives, policies, 
regulations, and standards; and (iii) establishes a linkage and relationship between privacy and 
security controls for purposes of enforcing respective privacy and security requirements which 
may overlap in concept and in implementation within federal information systems, programs, 
and organizations. Standardized privacy controls provide a more disciplined and structured 
approach for satisfying federal privacy requirements and demonstrating compliance to those 
                                                 
8 This includes risk to critical infrastructure/key resources described in Homeland Security Presidential Directive 7. 
9 Information system components include, for example, mainframes, workstations, servers (e.g., database, electronic 
mail, authentication, web, proxy, file, domain name), input/output devices (e.g., scanners, copiers, printers), network 
components (e.g., firewalls, routers, gateways, voice and data switches, process controllers, wireless access points, 
network appliances, sensors), operating systems, virtual machines, middleware, and applications.

requirements. Incorporating the same concepts used in managing information security risk, 
helps organizations implement privacy controls in a more cost-effective, risked-based manner. 
The guidelines in this special publication are applicable to all federal information systems10 
other than those systems designated as national security systems as defined in 44 U.S.C., 
Section 3542.11 The guidelines have been broadly developed from a technical perspective to 
complement similar guidelines for national security systems and may be used for such systems 
with the approval of appropriate federal officials exercising policy authority over such 
systems.12 State, local, and tribal governments, as well as private sector organizations are 
encouraged to consider using these guidelines, as appropriate. 
1.2   TARGET AUDIENCE 
This publication is intended to serve a diverse audience of information system and information 
security professionals including: 
• Individuals with information system, security, and/or risk management and oversight 
responsibilities (e.g., authorizing officials, chief information officers, senior information 
security officers,13 information system managers, information security managers); 
• Individuals with information system development responsibilities (e.g., program managers, 
system designers and developers, information security engineers, systems integrators); 
• Individuals with information security implementation and operational responsibilities (e.g., 
mission/business owners, information system owners, common control providers, information 
owners/stewards, system administrators, information system security officers); 
• Individuals with information security assessment and monitoring responsibilities (e.g., 
auditors, Inspectors General, system evaluators, assessors, independent verifiers/validators, 
analysts, information system owners); and 
• Commercial companies producing information technology products and systems, creating 
information security-related technologies, or providing information security services. 
1.3   RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER SECURITY CONTROL PUBLICATIONS 
To create a technically sound and broadly applicable set of security controls for information 
systems and organizations, a variety of sources were considered during the development of this 
special publication. The sources included security controls from the defense, audit, financial, 
healthcare, industrial/process control, and intelligence communities as well as controls defined by 
                                                 
10 A federal information system is an information system used or operated by an executive agency, by a contractor of an 
executive agency, or by another organization on behalf of an executive agency. 
11 A national security system is any information system (including any telecommunications system) used or operated by 
an agency or by a contractor of an agency, or other organization on behalf of an agency: (i) the function, operation, or 
use of which involves intelligence activities; involves cryptologic activities related to national security; involves 
command and control of military forces; involves equipment that is an integral part of a weapon or weapons system; or 
is critical to the direct fulfillment of military or intelligence missions (excluding a system that is to be used for routine 
administrative and business applications, e.g., payroll, finance, logistics, and personnel management applications); or 
(ii) is protected at all times by procedures established for information that have been specifically authorized under 
criteria established by an Executive Order or an Act of Congress to be kept classified in the interest of national defense 
or foreign policy. 
12 CNSS Instruction 1253 provides implementing guidance for national security systems. 
13 At the agency level, this position is known as the Senior Agency Information Security Officer. Organizations may 
also refer to this position as the Senior Information Security Officer or the Chief Information Security Officer.

national and international standards organizations. The objective of NIST Special Publication 
800-53 is to provide a set of security controls that can satisfy the breadth and depth of security 
requirements14 levied on organizations, mission/business processes, and information systems and 
that is consistent with and complementary to other established information security standards. 
The catalog of security controls in Special Publication 800-53 can be effectively used to protect 
information and information systems from traditional and advanced persistent threats in varied 
operational, environmental, and technical scenarios. The controls can also be used to demonstrate 
compliance with a variety of governmental, organizational, or institutional security requirements. 
Organizations have the responsibility to select the appropriate security controls, to implement the 
controls correctly, and to demonstrate the effectiveness of the controls in satisfying established 
security requirements.15 The security controls facilitate the development of assessment methods 
and procedures that can be used to demonstrate control effectiveness in a consistent/repeatable 
manner—thus contributing to the organization’s confidence that security requirements continue to 
be satisfied on an ongoing basis. In addition, security controls can be used in developing overlays 
for specialized information systems, information technologies, environments of operation, or 
communities of interest (see Appendix I). 
1.4   ORGANIZATIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES 
Organizations use FIPS Publication 199 to categorize their information and information systems. 
Security categorization is accomplished as an organization-wide activity16 with the involvement 
of senior-level organizational personnel including, for example, authorizing officials, chief 
information officers, senior information security officers, information owners and/or stewards, 
information system owners, and risk executive (function).17 Information is categorized at Tier 1 
(organization level) and at Tier 2 (mission/business process level). In accordance with FIPS 
Publication 200, organizations use the security categorization results from Tiers 1 and 2 to 
designate organizational information systems at Tier 3 (information system level) as low-impact, 
moderate-impact, or high-impact systems. For each organizational information system at Tier 3, 
the recommendation for security controls from the baseline controls defined in Appendix D is the 
starting point for the security control tailoring process. While the security control selection 
process is generally focused on information systems at Tier 3, the process is generally applicable 
across all three tiers of risk management. 
FIPS Publication 199 security categorization associates information and the operation and use of 
information systems with the potential worst-case adverse impact on organizational operations 
and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation.18 Organizational assessments of risk, 
including the use of specific and credible threat information, vulnerability information, and the 
likelihood of such threats exploiting vulnerabilities to cause adverse impacts, guide and inform 
                                                 
14 Security requirements are those requirements levied on an information system that are derived from laws, Executive 
Orders, directives, policies, instructions, regulations, standards, guidelines, or organizational (mission) needs to ensure 
the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the information being processed, stored, or transmitted. 
15 NIST Special Publication 800-53A provides guidance on assessing the effectiveness of security controls. 
16 See FIPS Publication 200, Footnote 7. 
17 Organizations typically exercise managerial, operational, and financial control over their information systems and the 
security provided to those systems, including the authority and capability to implement or require the security controls 
deemed necessary to protect organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation. 
18 Considerations for potential national-level impacts and impacts to other organizations in categorizing organizational 
information systems derive from the USA PATRIOT Act and Homeland Security Presidential Directives (HSPDs).

the tailoring process and the final selection of security controls.19 The final, agreed-upon set of 
security controls addressing specific organizational mission/business needs and tolerance for risk 
is documented with appropriate rationale in the security plan for the information system.20 The 
use of security controls from Special Publication 800-53 (including the baseline controls as a 
starting point in the control selection process), facilitates a more consistent level of security for 
federal information systems and organizations, while simultaneously preserving the flexibility 
and agility organizations need to address an increasingly sophisticated and hostile threat space, 
specific organizational missions/business functions, rapidly changing technologies, and in some 
cases, unique environments of operation. 
Achieving adequate information security for organizations, mission/business processes, and 
information systems is a multifaceted undertaking that requires: 
• Clearly articulated security requirements and security specifications; 
• Well-designed and well-built information technology products based on state-of-the-practice 
hardware, firmware, and software development processes; 
• Sound systems/security engineering principles and practices to effectively integrate 
information technology products into organizational information systems; 
• Sound security practices that are well documented and seamlessly integrated into the training 
requirements and daily routines of organizational personnel with security responsibilities; 
• Continuous monitoring of organizations and information systems to determine the ongoing 
effectiveness of deployed security controls, changes in information systems and environments 
of operation, and compliance with legislation, directives, policies, and standards;21 and 
• Information security planning and system development life cycle management.22 
From an engineering viewpoint, information security is just one of many required operational 
capabilities for information systems that support organizational mission/business processes—
capabilities that must be funded by organizations throughout the system development life cycle in 
order to achieve mission/business success. It is important that organizations realistically assess 
the risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation 
arising from mission/business processes and by placing information systems into operation or 
continuing operations. Realistic assessment of risk requires an understanding of threats to and 
vulnerabilities within organizations and the likelihood and potential adverse impacts of successful 
exploitations of such vulnerabilities by those threats.23 Finally, information security requirements 
must be satisfied with the full knowledge and consideration of the risk management strategy of 
                                                 
19 Risk assessments can be accomplished in a variety of ways depending on the specific needs of organizations. NIST 
Special Publication 800-30 provides guidance on the assessment of risk as part of an overall risk management process. 
20 Authorizing officials or designated representatives, by accepting the completed security plans, agree to the set of 
security controls proposed to meet the security requirements for organizations (including mission/business processes) 
and/or designated information systems. 
21 NIST Special Publication 800-137 provides guidance on continuous monitoring of organizational information 
systems and environments of operation. 
22 NIST Special Publication 800-64 provides guidance on the information security considerations in the system 
development life cycle. 
23 NIST Special Publication 800-30 provides guidance on the risk assessment process.

1.5   ORGANIZATION OF THIS SPECIAL PUBLICATION 
The remainder of this special publication is organized as follows: 
• Chapter Two describes the fundamental concepts associated with security control selection 
and specification including: (i) multitiered risk management; (ii) the structure of security 
controls and how the controls are organized into families; (iii) security control baselines as 
starting points for the tailoring process; (iv) the use of common controls and inheritance of 
security capabilities; (v) external environments and service providers; (vi) assurance and 
trustworthiness; and (vii) revisions and extensions to security controls and control baselines. 
• Chapter Three describes the process of selecting and specifying security controls for 
organizational information systems including: (i) selecting appropriate security control 
baselines; (ii) tailoring the baseline controls including developing specialized overlays; (iii) 
documenting the security control selection process; and (iv) applying the selection process to 
new and legacy systems. 
• Supporting appendices provide essential security control selection and specification-related 
information including: (i) general references; 25 (ii) definitions and terms; (iii) acronyms; (iv) 
baseline security controls for low-impact, moderate-impact, and high-impact information 
systems; (v) guidance on assurance and trustworthiness in information systems; (vi) a catalog

SECURITY CONTROL STRUCTURE, ORGANIZATION, BASELINES, AND ASSURANCE 
his chapter presents the fundamental concepts associated with security control selection 
and specification including: (i) three-tiered risk management; (ii) the structure of security

2.1   MULTITIERED RISK MANAGEMENT 
The selection and specification of security controls for an information system is accomplished as 
part of an organization-wide information security program for the management of risk—that is, 
the risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation 
associated with the operation of information systems. Risk-based approaches to security control 
selection and specification consider effectiveness, efficiency, and constraints due to applicable 
federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidelines. To 
integrate the risk management process throughout the organization and more effectively address 
mission/business concerns, a three-tiered approach is employed that addresses risk at the: (i) 
organization level; (ii) mission/business process level; and (iii) information system level. The risk 
management process is carried out across the three tiers with the overall objective of continuous 
improvement in the organization’s risk-related activities and effective inter-tier and intra-tier 
communication among all stakeholders having a shared interest in the mission/business success of 
the organization. Figure 1 illustrates the three-tiered approach to risk management.

Tier 1 provides a prioritization of organizational missions/business functions which in turn drives 
investment strategies and funding decisions—promoting cost-effective, efficient information 
technology solutions consistent with the strategic goals and objectives of the organization and 
measures of performance. Tier 2 includes: (i) defining the mission/business processes needed to 
support the organizational missions/business functions; (ii) determining the security categories of 
the information systems needed to execute the mission/business processes; (iii) incorporating 
information security requirements into the mission/business processes; and (iv) establishing an 
enterprise architecture (including an embedded information security architecture) to facilitate the 
allocation of security controls to organizational information systems and the environments in 
which those systems operate. The Risk Management Framework (RMF), depicted in Figure 2, is 
the primary means for addressing risk at Tier 3.27 This publication focuses on Step 2 of the RMF, 
the security control selection process, in the context of the three tiers in the organizational risk 
management hierarchy.

2.2   SECURITY CONTROL STRUCTURE 
Security controls described in this publication have a well-defined organization and structure. For 
ease of use in the security control selection and specification process, controls are organized into 
eighteen families.30 Each family contains security controls related to the general security topic of 
the family. A two-character identifier uniquely identifies security control families, for example, 
PS (Personnel Security). Security controls may involve aspects of policy, oversight, supervision, 
manual processes, actions by individuals, or automated mechanisms implemented by information 
systems/devices. Table 1 lists the security control families and the associated family identifiers in 
the security control catalog.31

28 CNSS Instruction 1253 provides security categorization guidance for national security systems. 
29 NIST Special Publication 800-53A provides guidance on assessing the effectiveness of security controls. 
30 Of the eighteen security control families in NIST Special Publication 800-53, seventeen families are described in the 
security control catalog in Appendix F, and are closely aligned with the seventeen minimum security requirements for 
federal information and information systems in FIPS Publication 200. One additional family (Program Management 
[PM] family) provides controls for information security programs required by FISMA. This family, while not 
specifically referenced in FIPS Publication 200, provides security controls at the organization level rather than the 
information system level. See Appendix G for a description of and implementation guidance for the PM controls. 
31 Privacy controls listed in Appendix J, have an organization and structure similar to security controls, including the 
use of two-character identifiers for the eight privacy families.

CHAPTER 2  PAGE 10 
The security control structure consists of the following components: (i) a control section; (ii) a 
supplemental guidance section; (iii) a control enhancements section; (iv) a references section; 
and (v) a priority and baseline allocation section. The following example from the Auditing and 
Accountability family illustrates the structure of a typical security control. 
AU-3 CONTENT OF AUDIT RECORDS 
 Control:  The information system generates audit records containing information that establishes 
what type of event occurred, when the event occurred, where the event occurred, the source of the 
event, the outcome of the event, and the identity of any individuals or subjects associated with the 
event. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Audit record content that may be necessary to satisfy the requirement of 
this control includes, for example, time stamps, source and destination addresses, user/process 
identifiers, event descriptions, success/fail indications, filenames involved, and access control or 
flow control rules invoked. Event outcomes can include indicators of event success or failure and 
event-specific results (e.g., the security state of the information system after the event occurred). 
Related controls: AU-2, AU-8, AU-12, SI-11. 
Control Enhancements: 
(1) CONTENT OF AUDIT RECORDS | ADDITIONAL AUDIT INFORMATION  
The information system generates audit records containing the following additional information: 
[Assignment: organization-defined additional, more detailed information]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Detailed information that organizations may consider in audit records 
includes, for example, full-text recording of privileged commands or the individual identities 
of group account users. Organizations consider limiting the additional audit information to 
only that information explicitly needed for specific audit requirements. This facilitates the use 
of audit trails and audit logs by not including information that could potentially be misleading 
or could make it more difficult to locate information of interest. 
(2) CONTENT OF AUDIT RECORDS | CENTRALIZED MANAGEMENT OF PLANNED AUDIT RECORD CONTENT  
The information system provides centralized management and configuration of the content to be 
captured in audit records generated by [Assignment: organization-defined information system 
components]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  This control enhancement requires that the content to be captured in 
audit records be configured from a central location (necessitating automation). Organizations 
coordinate the selection of required audit content to support the centralized management and 
configuration capability provided by the information system. Related controls: AU-6, AU-7. 
References:  None. 
Priority and Baseline Allocation: 
P1 LOW   AU-3 MOD   AU-3 (1) HIGH   AU-3 (1) (2) 
 
The control section prescribes specific security-related activities or actions to be carried out by 
organizations or by information systems. The term information system refers to those functions 
that generally involve the implementation of information technology (e.g., hardware, software, 
and firmware). Conversely, the term organization refers to activities that are generally process-
driven or entity-driven—that is, the security control is generally implemented through human or 
procedural-based actions. Security controls that use the term organization may still require some 
degree of automation to be fulfilled. Similarly, security controls that use the term information 
system may have some elements that are process-driven or entity-driven. Using the terms 
organization and/or information system does not preclude the application of security controls at 
any of the tiers in the risk management hierarchy (i.e., organization level, mission/business 
process level, information system level), as appropriate.  
Special Publication 800-53 Revision 4                                  Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems 
                                                                                               and Organizations 
________________________________________________________________________________________________ 
CHAPTER 2  PAGE 11 
For some security controls in the control catalog, a degree of flexibility is provided by allowing 
organizations to define values for certain parameters associated with the controls. This flexibility 
is achieved through the use of assignment and selection statements embedded within the security 
controls and control enhancements. Assignment and selection statements provide organizations 
with the capability to tailor security controls and control enhancements based on: (i) security 
requirements to support organizational missions/business functions and  operational needs; (ii) 
risk assessments and organizational risk tolerance; and (iii) security requirements originating in 
federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, or guidelines.32  
For example, organizations can specify additional information needed for audit records to support 
audit event processing. See the AU-3 (1) example above (i.e., [Assignment: organization-defined 
additional, more detailed information]). These assignments may include particular actions to be 
taken by information systems in the event of audit failures, the frequency of conducting system 
backups, restrictions on password use, or the distribution list for organizational policies and 
procedures.33 Once specified,34 the organization-defined values for assignment and selection 
statements become part of the security control, and the control implementation is assessed against 
the completed control statement. Assignment statements offer a high degree of flexibility by 
allowing organizations to specify parameter values, without requiring those values to be one of 
two or more specific predefined choices. In contrast, selection statements narrow the potential 
input values by providing a specific list of items from which organizations must choose.35 
The security control enhancements section provides statements of security capability to: (i) add 
functionality/specificity to a control; and/or (ii) increase the strength of a control. In both cases, 
control enhancements are used in information systems and environments of operation requiring 
greater protection than provided by the base control due to the potential adverse organizational 
impacts or when organizations seek additions to the base control functionality/specificity based 
on organizational assessments of risk. Security control enhancements are numbered sequentially 
within each control so that the enhancements can be easily identified when selected to supplement 
the base control. Each security control enhancement has a short subtitle to indicate the intended 
security capability provided by the control enhancement. In the AU-3 example, if the first control 
enhancement is selected, the control designation becomes AU-3 (1). The numerical designation of 
a control enhancement is used only to identify the particular enhancement within the control. The 
designation is not indicative of either the strength of the control enhancement or any hierarchical 
relationship among the enhancements. Control enhancements are not intended to be selected 
independently (i.e., if a control enhancement is selected, then the corresponding base security 
control must also be selected). This intent is reflected in the baseline specifications in Appendix 
D and in the baseline allocation section under each control in Appendix F. 
The supplemental guidance section provides non-prescriptive, additional information for a 
specific security control. Organizations can apply the supplemental guidance as appropriate, 
                                                 
32 In general, organization-defined parameters used in assignment and selection statements in the basic security 
controls apply also to all control enhancements associated with those controls. 
33 Organizations determine whether specific assignment or selection statements are completed at Tier 1 (organization 
level), Tier 2 (mission/business process level), Tier 3 (information system level), or a combination thereof. 
34 Organizations may choose to define specific values for security control parameters in policies, procedures, or 
guidance (which may be applicable to more than one information system) referencing the source documents in the 
security plan in lieu of explicitly completing the assignment/selection statements within the control as part of the plan. 
35 Security controls are generally designed to be technology- and implementation-independent, and therefore do not 
contain specific requirements in these areas. Organizations provide such requirements as deemed necessary in the 
security plan for the information system.

when defining, developing, and/or implementing security controls. The supplemental guidance 
can provide important considerations for implementing security controls in the context of 
operational environments, mission/business requirements, or assessments of risk and can also 
explain the purpose or meaning of particular controls. Security control enhancements may also 
contain supplemental guidance when the guidance is not applicable to the entire control but 
instead focused on a particular control enhancement. The supplemental guidance sections for 
security controls and control enhancements may contain a list of related controls. Related 
controls: (i) directly impact or support the implementation of a particular security control or 
control enhancement; (ii) address a closely related security capability; or (iii) are referenced in 
the supplemental guidance. Security control enhancements are by definition related to the base 
control. Related controls that are listed in the supplemental guidance for the base controls are not 
repeated in the supplemental guidance for the control enhancements. However, there may be 
related controls identified for control enhancements that are not listed in the base control. 
The security control enhancements section provides statements of security capability to: (i) add 
functionality/specificity to a control; and/or (ii) increase the strength of a control. In both cases, 
control enhancements are used in information systems and environments of operation requiring 
greater protection than provided by the base control due to the potential adverse organizational 
impacts or when organizations seek additions to the base control functionality/specificity based 
on organizational assessments of risk. Security control enhancements are numbered sequentially 
within each control so that the enhancements can be easily identified when selected to supplement 
the base control. Each security control enhancement has a short subtitle to indicate the intended 
security capability provided by the control enhancement. In the AU-3 example, if the first control 
enhancement is selected, the control designation becomes AU-3 (1). The numerical designation of 
a control enhancement is used only to identify the particular enhancement within the control. The 
designation is not indicative of either the strength of the control enhancement or any hierarchical 
relationship among the enhancements. Control enhancements are not intended to be selected 
independently (i.e., if a control enhancement is selected, then the corresponding base security 
control must also be selected). This intent is reflected in the baseline specifications in Appendix 
D and in the baseline allocation section under each control in Appendix F. 
The references section includes a list of applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, 
policies, regulations, standards, and guidelines (e.g., OMB Circulars/Memoranda, Homeland 
Security Presidential Directives, FIPS Publications, and NIST Special Publications) that are 
relevant to a particular security control.36 The references provide federal legislative and policy 
mandates as well as supporting information for the implementation of security controls and 
control enhancements. The references section also contains pertinent websites for organizations to 
use in obtaining additional information for security control implementation and assessment. 
The priority and security control baseline allocation section provides: (i) the recommended 
priority codes used for sequencing decisions during security control implementation; and (ii) the 
initial allocation of security controls and control enhancements to the baselines. Organizations 
can use the priority code designation associated with each security control to assist in making 
sequencing decisions for control implementation (i.e., a Priority Code 1 [P1] control has a higher 
priority for implementation than a Priority Code 2 [P2] control, a Priority Code 2 [P2] control has 
a higher priority for implementation than a Priority Code 3 [P3] control, and a Priority Code 0 
[P0] indicates the security control is not selected in any baseline). This recommended sequencing 
prioritization helps to ensure that the foundational security controls upon which other controls 
                                                 
36 Publications listed in the references section refer to the most recent versions of the publications. References are 
provided to assist organizations in applying the security controls and are not intended to be inclusive or complete.

depend are implemented first, thus enabling organizations to deploy controls in a more structured 
and timely manner in accordance with available resources. The implementation of security 
controls by sequence priority code does not imply the achievement of any defined level of risk 
mitigation until all of the security controls in the security plan have been implemented. The 
priority codes are intended only for implementation sequencing, not for making security control 
selection decisions.   
2.3   SECURITY CONTROL BASELINES 
Organizations are required to adequately mitigate the risk arising from use of information and 
information systems in the execution of missions and business functions. A significant challenge 
for organizations is to determine the most cost-effective, appropriate set of security controls, 
which if implemented and determined to be effective, would mitigate risk while complying with 
security requirements defined by applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, regulations, policies, 
directives, or standards (e.g., FISMA, OMB Circular A-130, HSPD-12, FIPS Publication 200). 
There is no one correct set of security controls that addresses all organizational security concerns 
in all situations. Selecting the most appropriate set of security controls for a specific situation or 
information system to adequately mitigate risk is an important task that requires a fundamental 
understanding of organizational mission/business priorities, the mission and business functions 
the information systems will support, and the environments of operation where the systems will 
reside. With that understanding, organizations can demonstrate how to most effectively assure the 
confidentiality, integrity, and availability of organizational information and information systems 
in a manner that supports mission/business needs while demonstrating due diligence. Selecting, 
implementing, and maintaining an appropriate set of security controls to adequately protect the 
information systems employed by organizations requires strong collaboration with system owners 
to understand ongoing changes to missions/business functions, environments of operation, and 
how the systems are used. 
To assist organizations in making the appropriate selection of security controls for information 
systems, the concept of baseline controls is introduced. Baseline controls are the starting point for 
the security control selection process described in this document and are chosen based on the 
security category and associated impact level of information systems determined in accordance 
with FIPS Publication 199 and FIPS Publication 200, respectively.37 Appendix D provides a 
listing of baseline security controls. Three sets of baseline security controls have been identified 
corresponding to the low-impact, moderate-impact, and high-impact information systems using 
the high water mark defined in FIPS Publication 200 and used in Section 3.1 of this document to 
provide an initial set of security controls for each impact level.38 
Appendix F provides a comprehensive catalog of security controls for information systems and 
organizations, arranged by control families. Chapter Three provides additional information on 
how to use FIPS Publication 199 security categories and FIPS Publication 200 system impact 
levels in applying the tailoring guidance to the baseline security controls to achieve adequate risk 
mitigation. Tailoring guidance, described in Section 3.2, helps organizations to customize the 
security control baselines selected using the results from organizational assessments of risk. 
Baseline tailoring actions include: (i) identifying and designating common controls; (ii) applying 
scoping considerations; (iii) selecting compensating controls; (iv) assigning specific values to 
                                                 
37 CNSS Instruction 1253 provides guidance on security control baselines for national security systems. 
38 The baseline security controls contained in Appendix D are not necessarily absolutes in that the guidance described 
in Section 3.2 provides organizations with the ability to tailor controls in accordance with the terms and conditions 
established by their authorizing officials and documented in their respective security plans.

security control parameters; (v) supplementing initial baselines with additional security controls 
or control enhancements; and (vi) providing additional information for control implementation. 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
2.4   SECURITY CONTROL DESIGNATIONS 
There are three distinct types of designations related to the security controls in Appendix F that 
define: (i) the scope of applicability for the control; (ii) the shared nature of the control; and (iii) 
the responsibility for control development, implementation, assessment, and authorization. These 
designations include common controls, system-specific controls, and hybrid controls. 
Common controls are security controls whose implementation results in a security capability that 
is inheritable by one or more organizational information systems. Security controls are deemed 
inheritable by information systems or information system components when the systems or 
components receive protection from the implemented controls but the controls are developed, 
implemented, assessed, authorized, and monitored by entities other than those responsible for the 
systems or components—entities internal or external to the organizations where the systems or 
components reside. Security capabilities provided by common controls can be inherited from 
many sources including, for example, organizations, organizational mission/business lines, sites, 
enclaves, environments of operation, or other information systems. Many of the controls needed 
to protect organizational information systems (e.g., security awareness training, incident response 
plans, physical access to facilities, rules of behavior) are excellent candidates for common control 
status. In addition, there can also be a variety of technology-based common controls (e.g., Public 
Key Infrastructure [PKI], authorized secure standard configurations for clients/servers, access 
control systems, boundary protection, cross-domain solutions). By centrally managing and 
documenting the development, implementation, assessment, authorization, and monitoring of 
common controls, security costs can be amortized across multiple information systems. 
The organization assigns responsibility for common controls to appropriate organizational 
officials (i.e., common control providers) and coordinates the development, implementation, 
assessment, authorization, and monitoring of the controls.39 The identification of common 
controls is most effectively accomplished as an organization-wide exercise with the active 
involvement of chief information officers, senior information security officers, the risk executive 
(function), authorizing officials, information owners/stewards, information system owners, and 
information system security officers. The organization-wide exercise considers the security 
categories of the information systems within the organization and the security controls necessary 
                                                 
39 The Chief Information Officer, Senior Information Security Officer, or other designated organizational officials at 
the senior leadership level assign responsibility for the development, implementation, assessment, authorization, and 
monitoring of common controls to appropriate entities (either internal or external to the organization). 
Implementation Tip 
There are security controls and control enhancements that appear in the security control catalog 
(Appendix F) that are found in only higher-impact baselines or are not used in any of the baselines. 
These additional security controls and control enhancements for information systems are available to 
organizations and can be used in tailoring security control baselines to achieve the needed level of 
protection in accordance with organizational assessments of risk. The set of security controls in the 
security plan must be sufficient to adequately mitigate risks to organizational operations and assets, 
individuals, other organizations, and the Nation based on the organizational risk tolerance.

to adequately mitigate the risks arising from the use of those systems (see baseline security 
controls in Section 2.3).40 Common control identification for the controls that impact multiple 
information systems, but not all systems across the organization could benefit from taking a 
similar approach. Key stakeholders collaborate to identify opportunities to effectively employ 
common controls at the mission/business line, site, or enclave level. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
When common controls protect multiple organizational information systems of differing impact 
levels, the controls are implemented with regard to the highest impact level among the systems. If 
the common controls are not implemented at the highest impact level of the information systems, 
system owners will need to factor this situation into their assessments of risk and take appropriate 
risk mitigation actions (e.g., adding security controls or control enhancements, changing assigned 
values of security control parameters, implementing compensating controls, or changing certain 
aspects of mission/business processes). Implementing common controls that are less than 
effective or that provide insufficient security capability for higher-impact information systems 
can have a significant adverse impact on organizational missions or business functions. 
Common controls are generally documented in the organization-wide information security 
program plan unless implemented as part of a specific information system, in which case the 
controls are documented in the security plan for that system.41 Organizations have the flexibility 
to describe common controls in a single document or in multiple documents with references or 
pointers, as appropriate. In the case of multiple documents, the documents describing common 
controls are included as attachments to the information security program plan. If the information 
security program plan contains multiple documents, organizations specify in each document the 
organizational officials responsible for development, implementation, assessment, authorization, 
and monitoring of the respective common controls. For example, the organization may require 
that the Facilities Management Office develop, implement, assess, authorize, and continuously 
monitor physical and environmental protection controls from the PE family when such controls 
are not associated with a particular information system but instead, support multiple systems.  
When common controls are included in a separate security plan for an information system (e.g., 
security controls employed as part of an intrusion detection system providing boundary protection 
inherited by one or more organizational information systems), the information security program 
plan indicates which separate security plan contains a description of the common controls. 
                                                 
40 Each common control identified by the organization is reviewed for applicability to each specific organizational 
information system, typically by information system owners and authorizing officials. 
41 Information security program plans are described in Appendix G. Organizations ensure that any security capabilities 
provided by common controls (i.e., security capabilities inheritable by other organizational entities) are described in 
sufficient detail to facilitate adequate understanding of the control implementation by inheriting entities. 
Implementation Tip 
The selection of common controls is most effectively accomplished on an organization-wide basis 
with the involvement of senior leadership (i.e., mission/business owners, authorizing officials, chief 
information officers, senior information security officers, information system owners, information 
owners/stewards, risk executives). These individuals have the collective knowledge to understand 
organizational priorities, the importance of organizational operations and assets, and the importance 
of the information systems that support those operations/assets. The senior leaders are also in the 
best position to select the common controls for each security control baseline and assign specific 
responsibilities for developing, implementing, assessing, authorizing, and monitoring those controls.

________________________________________________________________________________________________ 
CHAPTER 2  PAGE 16 
Common controls, whether employed in organizational information systems or environments of 
operation, are authorized by senior officials with at least the same level of authority/responsibility 
for managing risk as the authorization officials for information systems inheriting the controls. 
Authorization results for common controls are shared with the appropriate information system 
owners and authorizing officials. A plan of action and milestones is developed and maintained for 
common controls that have been determined through independent assessments, to be less than 
effective. Information system owners dependent on common controls that are less than effective 
consider whether they are willing to accept the associated risk or if additional tailoring is required 
to address the weaknesses or deficiencies in the controls. Such risk-based decisions are influenced 
by available resources, the trust models employed by the organization, and the risk tolerance of 
authorizing officials and the organization.42 Common controls are subject to the same assessment 
and monitoring requirements as system-specific controls employed in individual organizational 
information systems. Because common controls impact more than one system, a higher degree of 
confidence regarding the effectiveness of those controls may be required. 
Security controls not designated as common controls are considered system-specific or hybrid 
controls. System-specific controls are the primary responsibility of information system owners 
and their respective authorizing officials. Organizations assign a hybrid status to security controls 
when one part of the control is common and another part of the control is system-specific. For 
example, an organization may choose to implement the Incident Response Policy and Procedures 
security control (IR-1) as a hybrid control with the policy portion of the control designated as 
common and the procedures portion of the control designated as system-specific. Hybrid controls 
may also serve as predefined templates for further control refinement. Organizations may choose, 
for example, to implement the Contingency Planning security control (CP-2) as a predefined 
template for a generalized contingency plan for all organizational information systems with 
information system owners tailoring the plan, where appropriate, for system-specific uses. 
Partitioning security controls into common, hybrid, and system-specific controls can result in 
significant savings to organizations in implementation and assessment costs as well as a more 
consistent application of security controls organization-wide. While security control partitioning 
into common, hybrid, and system-specific controls is straightforward and intuitive conceptually, 
the actual application takes a significant amount of planning and coordination. At the information 
system level, determination of common, hybrid, or system-specific security controls follows the 
development of a tailored baseline. It is necessary to first determine what security capability is 
needed before organizations assign responsibility for how security controls are implemented, 
operated, and maintained. 
Security plans for individual information systems identify which security controls required for 
those systems have been designated by organizations as common controls and which controls 
have been designated as system-specific or hybrid controls. Information system owners are 
responsible for any system-specific implementation details associated with common controls. 
These implementation details are identified and described in the security plans for the individual 
information systems. Senior information security officers for organizations coordinate with 
common control providers (e.g., facility/site managers, human resources managers, intrusion 
detection system owners) to ensure that the required controls are developed, implemented, and 
assessed for effectiveness. Collectively, the security plans for individual information systems and 
the organization-wide information security program plans provide complete coverage for all 
security controls employed within organizations.   
                                                 
42 NIST Special Publication 800-39 provides guidance on trust models, including validated, direct historical, mediated, 
and mandated trust models.

CHAPTER 2  PAGE 17 
The determination as to whether a security control is a common, hybrid, or system-specific is 
context-based. Security controls cannot be determined to be common, hybrid, or system-specific 
simply based on reviewing the language of the control. For example, a control may be system-
specific for a particular information system, but at the same time that control could be a common 
control for another system, which would inherit the control from the first system. One indicator of 
whether a system-specific control may also be a common control for other information systems is 
to consider who or what depends on the functionality of that particular control. If a certain part of 
an information system or solution external to the system boundary depends on the control, then 
that control may be a candidate for common control identification. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.5   EXTERNAL SERVICE PROVIDERS 
Organizations are becoming increasingly reliant on information system services provided by 
external providers to conduct important missions and business functions. External information 
system services are computing and information technology services implemented outside of the 
traditional security authorization boundaries established by organizations for their information 
systems. Those traditional authorization boundaries linked to physical space and control of assets, 
are being extended (both physically and logically) with the growing use of external services. In 
this context, external services can be provided by: (i) entities within the organization but outside 
of the security authorization boundaries established for organizational information systems; (ii) 
entities outside of the organization either in the public sector (e.g., federal agencies) or private 
Implementation Tip 
• Organizations consider the inherited risk from the use of common controls. Security plans, 
security assessment reports, and plans of action and milestones for common controls (or a 
summary of such information) are made available to information system owners (for systems 
inheriting the controls) after the information is reviewed and approved by the senior official or 
executive responsible and accountable for the controls. 
• Organizations ensure that common control providers keep control status information current 
since the controls typically support multiple organizational information systems. Security plans, 
security assessment reports, and plans of action and milestones for common controls are used 
by authorizing officials to make risk-based decisions in the security authorization process for 
their information systems and therefore, inherited risk from common controls is a significant 
factor in such risk-based decisions. 
• Organizations ensure that common control providers have the capability to rapidly broadcast 
changes in the status of common controls that adversely affect the protections being provided by 
and expected of the common controls. Common control providers inform system owners when 
problems arise in the inherited common controls (e.g., when an assessment or reassessment of 
a common control indicates the control is flawed or deficient in some manner, or when a new 
threat or attack method arises that renders the common control less than effective in protecting 
against the new threat or attack method). 
• Organizations are encouraged to employ automated management systems to maintain records 
of the specific common controls employed in each organizational information system to enhance 
the ability of common control providers to rapidly communicate with system owners. 
• If common controls are provided to organizations by entities external to the organization (e.g., 
shared and/or external service providers), arrangements are made with the external/shared 
service providers by the organization to obtain information on the effectiveness of the deployed 
controls. Information obtained from external organizations regarding effectiveness of common 
controls is factored into authorization decisions.

sector (e.g., commercial service providers); or (iii) some combination of the public and private 
sector options. External information system services include, for example, the use of service-
oriented architectures (SOAs), cloud-based services (infrastructure, platform, software), or data 
center operations. External information system services may be used by, but are typically not part 
of, organizational information systems. In some situations, external information system services 
may completely replace or heavily augment the routine functionality of internal organizational 
information systems. 
FISMA and OMB policies require that federal agencies using external service providers to 
process, store, or transmit federal information or operate information systems on behalf of the 
federal government, assure that such use meets the same security requirements that federal 
agencies are required to meet. Security requirements for external service providers including the 
security controls for external information systems are expressed in contracts or other formal 
agreements.43 Organizations are responsible and accountable for the information security risk 
incurred by the use of information system services provided by external providers. Such risk is 
addressed by incorporating the Risk Management Framework (RMF) as part of the terms and 
conditions of the contracts with external providers. Organizations can require external providers 
to implement all steps in the RMF except the security authorization step, which remains an 
inherent federal responsibility directly linked to managing the information security risk related to 
the use of external information system services.44 Organizations can also require external 
providers to provide appropriate evidence to demonstrate that they have complied with the RMF 
in protecting federal information. However, federal agencies take direct responsibility for the 
overall security of such services by authorizing the information systems providing the services. 
Relationships with external service providers are established in a variety of ways, for example, 
through joint ventures, business partnerships, outsourcing arrangements (i.e., through contracts, 
interagency agreements, lines of business arrangements, service-level agreements), licensing 
agreements, and/or supply chain exchanges. The growing use of external service providers and 
new relationships being forged with those providers present new and difficult challenges for 
organizations, especially in the area of information system security. These challenges include: 
• Defining the types of external information system services provided to organizations; 
• Describing how those external services are protected in accordance with the information 
security requirements of organizations; and 
• Obtaining the necessary assurances that the risk to organizational operations and assets, 
individuals, other organizations, and the Nation arising from the use of the external services 
is acceptable. 
The degree of confidence that the risk from using external services is at an acceptable level 
depends on the trust that organizations place in external service providers. In some cases, the 
level of trust is based on the amount of direct control organizations are able to exert on external 
service providers with regard to employment of security controls necessary for the protection of 
                                                 
43 Organizations consult the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) when acquiring cloud 
services from external providers. FedRAMP addresses required security controls and independent assessments for a 
variety of cloud services. Additional information is available at http://www.fedramp.gov. 
44 To effectively manage information security risk, organizations authorize information systems of external providers 
that are part of the information technologies or services (e.g., infrastructure, platform, or software) provided to the 
federal government. Security authorization requirements are expressed in the terms and conditions of contracts with 
external providers of those information technologies and services.

CHAPTER 2  PAGE 19 
the service/information and the evidence brought forth as to the effectiveness of those controls.45 
The level of control is usually established by the terms and conditions of the contracts or service-
level agreements with the external service providers and can range from extensive control (e.g., 
negotiating contracts or agreements that specify detailed security requirements for the providers) 
to very limited control (e.g., using contracts or service-level agreements to obtain commodity 
services46 such as commercial telecommunications services). In other cases, levels of trust are 
based on factors that convince organizations that required security controls have been employed 
and that determinations of control effectiveness exist. For example, separately authorized external 
information system services provided to organizations through well-established lines of business 
relationships may provide degrees of trust in such services within the tolerable risk range of the 
authorizing officials and organizations using the services. 
The provision of services by external providers may result in certain services without explicit 
agreements between organizations and the providers. Whenever explicit agreements are feasible 
and practical (e.g., through contracts, service-level agreements), organizations develop such 
agreements and require the use of the security controls in Appendix F of this publication. When 
organizations are not in a position to require explicit agreements with external service providers 
(e.g., services are imposed on organizations, services are commodity services), organizations 
establish and document explicit assumptions about service capabilities with regard to security. In 
situations where organizations are procuring information system services through centralized 
acquisition vehicles (e.g., governmentwide contracts by the General Services Administration or 
other preferred and/or mandatory acquisition organizations), it may be more efficient and cost-
effective for contract originators to establish and maintain stated levels of trust with external 
service providers (including the definition of required security controls and level of assurance 
with regard to the provision of such controls). Organizations subsequently acquiring information 
system services from centralized contracts can take advantage of the negotiated levels of trust 
established by the procurement originators and thus avoid costly repetition of activities necessary 
to establish such trust.47 Centralized acquisition vehicles (e.g., contracts) may also require the 
active participation of organizations. For example, organizations may be required by provisions in 
contracts or agreements to install public key encryption-enabled client software recommended by 
external service providers. 
Ultimately, the responsibility for adequately mitigating unacceptable risks arising from the use of 
external information system services remains with authorizing officials. Organizations require 
that appropriate chains of trust be established with external service providers when dealing with 
the many issues associated with information system security. Organizations establish and retain a 
level of trust that participating service providers in the potentially complex consumer-provider 
                                                 
45 The level of trust that organizations place in external service providers can vary widely, ranging from those who are 
highly trusted (e.g., business partners in a joint venture that share a common business model and common goals) to 
those who are less trusted and represent greater sources of risk (e.g., business partners in one endeavor who are also 
competitors in another market sector). NIST Special Publication 800-39 describes different trust models that can be 
employed by organizations when establishing relationships with external service providers. 
46 Commercial providers of commodity-type services typically organize their business models and services around the 
concept of shared resources and devices for a broad and diverse customer base. Therefore, unless organizations obtain 
fully dedicated services from commercial service providers, there may be a need for greater reliance on compensating 
security controls to provide the necessary protections for the information system that relies on those external services.  
Organizational assessments of risk and risk mitigation activities reflect this situation. 
47 For example, procurement originators could authorize information systems providing external services to the federal 
government under the specific terms and conditions of the contracts. Federal agencies requesting such services under 
the terms of the contracts would not be required to reauthorize the information systems when acquiring such services 
(unless the request included services outside the scope of the original contracts).

CHAPTER 2  PAGE 20 
relationship provide adequate protection for the services rendered to organizations. The chain of 
trust can be complicated due to the number of entities participating in the consumer-provider 
relationship and the types of relationships between the parties. External service providers may 
also outsource selected services to other external entities, making the chain of trust more difficult 
and complicated to manage. Depending on the nature of the services, organizations may find it 
impossible to place significant trust in external providers. This situation is due not to any inherent 
untrustworthiness on the part of providers, but to the intrinsic level of risk in the services.48  
Where a sufficient level of trust cannot be established in the external services and/or providers, 
organizations can: (i) mitigate the risk by employing compensating controls; (ii) accept the risk 
within the level of organizational risk tolerance; (iii) transfer risk by obtaining insurance to cover 
potential losses; or (iv) avoid risk by choosing not to obtain the services from certain providers 
(resulting in performance of missions/business operations with reduced levels of functionality or 
possibly no functionality at all).49 For example, in the case of cloud-based information systems 
and/or services, organizations might require as a compensating control, that all information stored 
in the cloud be encrypted for added security of the information. Alternatively, organizations may 
require encrypting some of the information stored in the cloud (depending on the criticality or 
sensitivity of such information)—accepting additional risk but limiting the risk of not storing all 
information in an unencrypted form. 
2.6   ASSURANCE AND TRUSTWORTHINESS 
Assurance and trustworthiness of information systems, system components, and information 
system services are becoming an increasingly important part of the risk management strategies 
developed by organizations. Whether information systems are deployed to support, for example, 
the operations of the national air traffic control system, a major financial institution, a nuclear 
power plant providing electricity for a large city, or the military services and warfighters, the 
systems must be reliable, trustworthy, and resilient in the face of increasingly sophisticated and 
pervasive threats. To understand how organizations achieve trustworthy systems and the role 
assurance plays in the trustworthiness factor, it is important to first define the term trust. Trust, in 
general, is the belief that an entity will behave in a predictable manner while performing specific 
functions, in specific environments, and under specified conditions or circumstances. The entity 
may be a person, process, information system, system component, system-of-systems, or any 
combination thereof.  
From an information security perspective, trust is the belief that a security-relevant entity will 
behave in a predictable manner when satisfying a defined set of security requirements under 
specified conditions/circumstances and while subjected to disruptions, human errors, component 
faults and failures, and purposeful attacks that may occur in the environment of operation. Trust 
is usually determined relative to a specific security capability50 and can be decided relative to an 
individual system component or the entire information system. However, trust at the information 
system level is not achieved as a result of composing a security capability from a set of trusted 
system components—rather, trust at the system level is an inherently subjective determination 
that is derived from the complex interactions among entities (i.e., technical components, physical 
                                                 
48 There may also be risk in disallowing certain functionality because of security concerns. Security is merely one of 
multiple considerations in an overall risk determination. 
49 Alternative providers offering a higher basis for trust, usually at a higher cost, may be available. 
50 A security capability is a combination of mutually reinforcing security controls (i.e., safeguards/countermeasures) 
implemented by technical means (i.e., functionality in hardware, software, and firmware), physical means (i.e., physical 
devices and protective measures), and/or procedural means (i.e., procedures performed by individuals). 
Special Publication 800-53 Revision 4                                  Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems 
                                                                                               and Organizations 
________________________________________________________________________________________________ 
CHAPTER 2  PAGE 21 
components, and individuals), taking into account the life cycle activities that govern, develop, 
operate, and sustain the system. In essence, to have trust in a security capability requires that 
there is a sufficient basis for trust, or trustworthiness, in the set of security-relevant entities that 
are to be composed to provide such capability.  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Trustworthiness with respect to information systems, expresses the degree to which the systems 
can be expected to preserve with some degree of confidence, the confidentiality, integrity, and 
availability of the information that is being processed, stored, or transmitted by the systems across 
a range of threats.51 Trustworthy information systems are systems that are believed to be capable 
of operating within a defined risk tolerance despite the environmental disruptions, human errors, 
structural failures, and purposeful attacks that are expected to occur in the environments in which 
                                                 
51 While information is the primary area of concern, trustworthiness applies to the protections for all assets deemed 
critical by organizations. Furthermore, protections are provided by technology (i.e., hardware, software, firmware), 
physical elements (i.e., doors, locks, surveillance), and human elements (i.e., people, processes, procedures). 
Security Capability 
Organizations can consider defining a set of security capabilities as a precursor to the security 
control selection process. The concept of security capability is a construct that recognizes that the 
protection of information being processed, stored, or transmitted by information systems, seldom 
derives from a single safeguard or countermeasure (i.e., security control). In most cases, such 
protection results from the selection and implementation of a set of mutually reinforcing security 
controls. For example, organizations may wish to define a security capability for secure remote 
authentication. This capability can be achieved by the selection and implementation of a set of 
security controls from Appendix F (e.g., IA-2 [1], IA-2 [2], IA-2 [8], IA-2 [9], and SC-8 [1]). Moreover, 
security capabilities can address a variety of areas that can include, for example, technical means, 
physical means, procedural means, or any combination thereof. Thus, in addition to the above 
functional capability for secure remote access, organizations may also need security capabilities that 
address physical means such as tamper detection on a cryptographic module or anomaly 
detection/analysis on an orbiting spacecraft. 
As the number of security controls in Appendix F grows over time in response to an increasingly 
sophisticated threat space, it is important for organizations to have the ability to describe key security 
capabilities needed to protect core organizational missions/business functions, and to subsequently 
define a set of security controls that if properly designed, developed, and implemented, produce 
such capabilities. This simplifies how the protection problem is viewed conceptually. In essence, 
using the construct of security capability provides a shorthand method of grouping security controls 
that are employed for a common purpose or to achieve a common objective. This becomes an 
important consideration, for example, when assessing security controls for effectiveness. 
Traditionally, assessments have been conducted on a control-by-control basis producing results that 
are characterized as pass (i.e., control satisfied) or fail (i.e., control not satisfied). However, the 
failure of a single control or in some cases, the failure of multiple controls, may not affect the overall 
security capability needed by an organization. Moreover, employing the broader construct of security 
capability allows an organization to assess the severity of vulnerabilities discovered in its information 
systems and determine if the failure of a particular security control (associated with a vulnerability) or 
the decision not to deploy a certain control, affects the overall capability needed for mission/business 
protection. It also facilitates conducting root cause analyses to determine if the failure of one security 
control can be traced to the failure of other controls based on the established relationships among 
controls. Ultimately, authorization decisions (i.e., risk acceptance decisions) are made based on the 
degree to which the desired security capabilities have been effectively achieved and are meeting the 
security requirements defined by an organization. These risk-based decisions are directly related to 
organizational risk tolerance that is defined as part of an organization’s risk management strategy.

CHAPTER 2  PAGE 22 
the systems operate—systems that have the trustworthiness to successfully carry out assigned 
missions/business functions under conditions of stress and uncertainty. 
Two fundamental components affecting the trustworthiness of information systems are security 
functionality and security assurance. Security functionality is typically defined in terms of the 
security features, functions, mechanisms, services, procedures, and architectures implemented 
within organizational information systems or the environments in which those systems operate. 
Security assurance is the measure of confidence that the security functionality is implemented 
correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting the 
security requirements for the system—thus possessing the capability to accurately mediate and 
enforce established security policies. Security controls address both security functionality and 
security assurance. Some controls focus primarily on security functionality (e.g., PE-3, Physical 
Access Control; IA-2, Identification and Authentication; SC-13, Cryptographic Protection; AC-2, 
Account Management). Other controls focus primarily on security assurance (e.g., CA-2, Security 
Assessment; SA-17, Developer Security Architecture and Design; CM-3, Configuration Change 
Control). Finally, certain security controls can support security functionality and assurance (e.g., 
RA-5, Vulnerability Scanning; SC-3, Security Function Isolation; AC-25, Reference Monitor). 
Security controls related to functionality are combined to develop a security capability with the 
assurance-related controls implemented to provide a degree of confidence in the capability within 
the organizational risk tolerance. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Assurance Evidence—From Developmental and Operational Activities 
Organizations obtain security assurance by the actions taken by information system developers, 
implementers, operators, maintainers, and assessors. Actions by individuals and/or groups during 
the development/operation of information systems produce security evidence that contributes to 
the assurance, or measures of confidence, in the security functionality needed to deliver the 
security capability. The depth and coverage of these actions (as described in Appendix E) also 
contribute to the efficacy of the evidence and measures of confidence. The evidence produced by 
developers, implementers, operators, assessors, and maintainers during the system development 
life cycle (e.g., design/development artifacts, assessment results, warranties, and certificates of 
evaluation/validation) contributes to the understanding of the security controls implemented by 
organizations. 
The strength of security functionality52 plays an important part in being able to achieve the 
needed security capability and subsequently satisfying the security requirements of organizations. 
                                                 
52 The security strength of an information system component (i.e., hardware, software, or firmware) is determined by 
the degree to which the security functionality implemented within that component is correct, complete, resistant to 
direct attacks (strength of mechanism), and resistant to bypass or tampering. 
The Compelling Argument for Assurance 
Organizations specify assurance-related controls to define activities performed to generate relevant 
and credible evidence about the functionality and behavior of organizational information systems and 
to trace the evidence to the elements that provide such functionality/behavior. This evidence is used 
to obtain a degree of confidence that the systems satisfy stated security requirements—and do so 
while effectively supporting the organizational missions/business functions while being subjected to 
threats in the intended environments of operation.

CHAPTER 2  PAGE 23 
Information system developers can increase the strength of security functionality by employing as 
part of the hardware/software/firmware development process: (i) well-defined security policies 
and policy models; (ii) structured/rigorous design and development techniques; and (iii) sound 
system/security engineering principles. The artifacts generated by these development activities 
(e.g., functional specifications, high-level/low-level designs, implementation representations 
[source code and hardware schematics], the results from static/dynamic testing and code analysis) 
can provide important evidence that the information systems (including the components that 
compose those systems) will be more reliable and trustworthy. Security evidence can also be 
generated from security testing conducted by independent, accredited, third-party assessment 
organizations (e.g., Common Criteria Testing Laboratories, Cryptographic/Security Testing 
Laboratories, and other assessment activities by government and private sector organizations53).  
In addition to the evidence produced in the development environment, organizations can produce 
evidence from the operational environment that contributes to the assurance of functionality and 
ultimately, security capability. Operational evidence includes, for example, flaw reports, records 
of remediation actions, the results of security incident reporting, and the results of organizational 
continuous monitoring activities. Such evidence helps to determine the effectiveness of deployed 
security controls, changes to information systems and environments of operation, and compliance 
with federal legislation, policies, directives, regulations, and standards. Security evidence, 
whether obtained from development or operational activities, provides a better understanding of 
security controls implemented and used by organizations. Together, the actions taken during the 
system development life cycle by developers, implementers, operators, maintainers, and assessors 
and the evidence produced as part of those actions, help organizations to determine the extent to 
which the security functionality within their information systems is implemented correctly, 
operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting stated security 
requirements and enforcing or mediating established security policies—thus providing greater 
confidence in the security capability. 
With regard to the security evidence produced, the depth and coverage of such evidence can 
affect the level of assurance in the functionality implemented. Depth and coverage are attributes 
associated with assessment methods and the generation of security evidence. Assessment methods 
can be applied to developmental and operational assurance. For developmental assurance, depth 
is associated with the rigor, level of detail, and formality of the artifacts produced during the 
design and development of the hardware, software, and firmware components of information 
systems (e.g., functional specifications, high-level design, low-level design, source code). The 
level of detail available in development artifacts can affect the type of testing, evaluation, and 
analysis conducted during the system development life cycle (e.g., black-box testing, gray-box 
testing, white-box testing, static/dynamic analysis). For operational assurance, the depth attribute 
addresses the number and types of assurance-related security controls selected and implemented. 
In contrast, the coverage attribute is associated with the assessment methods employed during 
development and operations, addressing the scope and breadth of assessment objects included in 
the assessments (e.g., number/types of tests conducted on source code, number of software 
modules reviewed, number of network nodes/mobile devices scanned for vulnerabilities, number 
of individuals interviewed to check basic understanding of contingency responsibilities).54  
                                                 
53 For example, third-party assessment organizations assess cloud services and service providers in support of the 
Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP). Common Criteria Testing Laboratories test and 
evaluate information technology products using ISO/IEC standard 15408. Cryptographic/Security Testing Laboratories 
test cryptographic modules using the FIPS 140-2 standard. 
54 NIST Special Publication 800-53A provides guidance on the generation of security evidence related to security 
assessments conducted during the system development life cycle.

CHAPTER 2  PAGE 24 
Addressing assurance-related controls during acquisition and system development can help 
organizations to obtain sufficiently trustworthy information systems and components that are 
more reliable and less likely to fail. These controls include ensuring that developers employ 
sound systems security engineering principles and processes including, for example, providing a 
comprehensive security architecture, and enforcing strict configuration management and control 
of information system and software changes. Once information systems are deployed, assurance-
related controls can help organizations to continue to have confidence in the trustworthiness of 
the systems. These controls include, for example, conducting integrity checks on software and 
firmware components, conducting penetration testing to find vulnerabilities in organizational 
information systems, monitoring established secure configuration settings, and developing 
policies/procedures that support the operation and use of the systems. 
The concepts described above, including security requirements, security capability, security 
controls, security functionality, and security assurance, are brought together in a model for 
trustworthiness for information systems and system components. Figure 3 illustrates the key 
components in the model and the relationship among the components.

CHAPTER 2  PAGE 25 
Developmental and Operational Activities to Achieve High Assurance 
Raising the bar on assurance can be difficult and costly for organizations—but sometimes 
essential for critical applications, missions, or business functions. Determining what parts of the 
organization’s information technology infrastructure demand higher assurance of implemented 
security functionality is a Tier 1/Tier 2 risk management activity (see Figure 1 in Chapter Two). 
This type of activity occurs when organizations determine the security requirements necessary to 
protect organizational operations (i.e., mission, functions, image, and reputation), organizational 
assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation. Determining security requirements and 
the associated security capabilities needed to generate the appropriate protection is an integral 
part of the organizational risk management process described in NIST Special Publication 800-
39—specifically, in the development of the risk response strategy following the risk framing and 
risk assessment steps (where organizations establish priorities, assumptions, constraints, risk 
tolerance and assess threats, vulnerabilities, mission/business impacts, and likelihood of threat 
occurrence). After the security requirements and security capabilities are determined at Tiers 1 
and 2 (including the necessary assurance requirements to provide measures of confidence in the 
desired capabilities), those requirements/capabilities are reflected in the design of the enterprise 
architecture, the associated mission/business processes, and the organizational information 
systems that are needed to support those processes. Organizations can use the Risk Management 
Framework (RMF), described in NIST Special Publication 800-37, to ensure that the appropriate 
assurance levels are achieved for the information systems and system components deployed to 
carry out core missions and business functions. This is primarily a Tier 3 activity but can have 
some overlap with Tiers 1 and 2, for example, in the area of common control selection. 
Trustworthy information systems are difficult to build from a software and systems development 
perspective. However, there are a number of design, architectural, and implementation principles 
that, if used, can result in more trustworthy systems. These core security principles include, for 
example, simplicity, modularity, layering, domain isolation, least privilege, least functionality, 
and resource isolation/encapsulation. Information technology products and systems exhibiting a 
higher degree of trustworthiness (i.e., products/systems having the requisite security functionality 
and security assurance) are expected to exhibit a lower rate of latent design/implementation flaws 
and a higher degree of penetration resistance against a range of threats including, for example, 
sophisticated cyber attacks, natural disasters, accidents, and intentional/unintentional errors.55 The 
vulnerability and susceptibility of organizational missions/business functions and supporting 
information systems to known threats, the environments of operation where those systems are 
deployed, and the maximum acceptable level of information security risk, guide the degree of 
trustworthiness needed. 
Appendix E describes the minimum assurance requirements for federal information systems and 
organizations and highlights the assurance-related controls in the security control baselines in 
Appendix D needed to ensure that the requirements are satisfied.56 
  
                                                 
55 Organizations also rely to a great extent on security assurance from an operational perspective as illustrated by the 
assurance-related controls in Tables E-1 through E-3. Operational assurance is obtained by other than developmental 
actions including for example, defining and applying security configuration settings on information technology 
products, establishing policies and procedures, assessing security controls, and conducting a rigorous continuous 
monitoring program. In some situations, to achieve the necessary security capability with weak or deficient information 
technology, organizations compensate by increasing their operational assurance. 
56 CNSS Instruction 1253 designates security control baselines for national security systems. Therefore, the assurance-
related controls in the baselines established for the national security community, if so designated, may differ from those 
controls designated for non-national security systems.

2.7   REVISIONS AND EXTENSIONS 
The security controls listed in this publication represent the state-of-the-practice safeguards and 
countermeasures for federal information systems and organizations. The security controls57 will 
be carefully reviewed and revised periodically to reflect: 
• Experience gained from using the controls; 
• New federal legislation, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, or policies; 
• Changing security requirements; 
• Emerging threats, vulnerabilities, and attack methods; and 
• Availability of new technologies. 
The security controls in the security control catalog are expected to change over time, as controls 
are withdrawn, revised, and added. The security controls defined in the low, moderate, and high 
baselines are also expected to change over time as the level of security and due diligence for 
mitigating risks within organizations changes. In addition to the need for change, the need for 
stability is addressed by requiring that proposed modifications to security controls go through a 
                                                 
57 The privacy controls listed in Appendix J will also be updated on a regular basis using similar criteria. 
Why Assurance Matters 
The importance of security assurance can be described by using the example of a light switch on a 
wall in the living room of your house. Individuals can observe that by simply turning the switch on and 
off, the switch appears to be performing according to its functional specification. This is analogous to 
conducting black-box testing of security functionality in an information system or system component. 
However, the more important questions might be— 
• Does the light switch do anything else besides what it is supposed to do? 
• What does the light switch look like from behind the wall? 
• What types of components were used to construct the light switch and how was the switch 
assembled? 
• Did the switch manufacturer follow industry best practices in the development process? 
This example is analogous to the many developmental activities that address the quality of the 
security functionality in an information system or system component including, for example, design 
principles, coding techniques, code analysis, testing, and evaluation. 
The security assurance requirements and associated assurance-related controls in Appendix E 
address the light switch problem from the front of the wall perspective, and potentially from the 
behind the wall perspective, depending on the measure of confidence needed about the component 
in question. For organizational missions/business functions that are less critical (i.e., low impact), 
lower levels of assurance might be appropriate. However, as missions/business functions become 
more important (i.e., moderate or high impact) and information systems and organizations become 
susceptible to advanced persistent threats by high-end adversaries, increased levels of assurance 
may be required. In addition, as organizations become more dependent on external information 
system services and providers, assurance becomes more important—providing greater insight and 
measures of confidence to organizations in understanding and verifying the security capability of 
external providers and the services provided to the federal government. Thus, when the potential 
impact to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, or the Nation is 
great, an increasing level of effort must be directed at what is happening behind the wall.

CHAPTER THREE 
THE PROCESS 
SELECTION AND SPECIFICATION OF SECURITY CONTROLS 
his chapter describes the process of selecting and specifying security controls and control 
enhancements for organizational information systems to include: (i) selecting appropriate 
security control baselines; (ii) tailoring the baselines; (iii) documenting the security control 
selection process; and (iv) applying the control selection process to new development and legacy 
systems. 
3.1   SELECTING SECURITY CONTROL BASELINES 
In preparation for selecting and specifying the appropriate security controls for organizational 
information systems and their respective environments of operation, organizations first determine 
the criticality and sensitivity of the information to be processed, stored, or transmitted by those 
systems. This process, known as security categorization, is described in FIPS Publication 199.58 
The security categorization standard is based on a simple and well-established concept—that is, 
determining the potential adverse impact for organizational information systems. The results of 
security categorization help guide and inform the selection of appropriate security controls (i.e., 
safeguards and countermeasures) to adequately protect those information systems. The security 
controls selected for information systems are commensurate with the potential adverse impact on 
organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, or the Nation if there is a 
loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability. FIPS Publication 199 requires organizations to 
categorize information systems as low-impact, moderate-impact, or high-impact for the stated 
security objectives of confidentiality, integrity, and availability (RMF Step 1). The potential 
impact values assigned to the security objectives are the highest values (i.e., high water mark) 
from the security categories that have been determined for each type of information processed, 
stored, or transmitted by those information systems.59 The generalized format for expressing the 
security category (SC) of an information system is: 
SC information system  = {(confidentiality, impact), (integrity, impact), (availability, impact)}, 
where the acceptable values for potential impact are low, moderate, or high. 
Since the potential impact values for confidentiality, integrity, and availability may not always be 
the same for a particular information system, the high water mark concept (introduced in FIPS 
Publication 199) is used in FIPS Publication 200 to determine the impact level of the information 
system for the express purpose of selecting an initial set of security controls from one of the three 
security control baselines.60 Thus, a low-impact system is defined as an information system in 
which all three of the security objectives are low. A moderate-impact system is an information 
system in which at least one of the security objectives is moderate and no security objective is 
                                                 
58 CNSS Instruction 1253 provides security categorization guidance for national security systems. 
59 NIST Special Publication 800-60, Guide for Mapping Types of Information and Information Systems to Security 
Categories, provides guidance on the assignment of security categories to information systems. 
60 The high water mark concept is employed because there are significant dependencies among the security objectives 
of confidentiality, integrity, and availability. In most cases, a compromise in one security objective ultimately affects 
the other security objectives as well. Accordingly, security controls are not categorized by security objective. Rather, 
the security controls are grouped into baselines to provide a general protection capability for classes of information 
systems based on impact level.

CHAPTER 3   PAGE 29 
greater than moderate. Finally, a high-impact system is an information system in which at least 
one security objective is high. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Once the impact level of the information system is determined, organizations begin the security 
control selection process (RMF Step 2). The first step in selecting and specifying security controls 
for the information system is to choose an appropriate set of baseline controls.61 The selection of 
the initial security control baseline is based on the impact level of the information system as 
determined by the security categorization process described above. The organization selects one 
of three sets of baseline security controls from Appendix D corresponding to the low-impact, 
moderate-impact, or high-impact rating of the information system.62 Note that not all security 
controls are assigned to baselines, as indicated in Table D-2 by the phrase not selected. Similarly, 
as illustrated in Tables D-3 through D-19, not all control enhancements are assigned to baselines. 
Those control enhancements that are assigned to baselines are so indicated by an “x” in the low, 
moderate, or high columns. The use of the term baseline is intentional. The security controls and 
control enhancements in the baselines are a starting point from which controls/enhancements may 
be removed, added, or specialized based on the tailoring guidance in Section 3.2. 
The security control baselines in Appendix D address the security needs of a broad and diverse 
set of constituencies (including individual users and organizations). Some assumptions that 
generally underlie the baselines in Appendix D include, for example: (i) the environments in 
which organizational information systems operate; (ii) the nature of operations conducted by 
organizations; (iii) the functionality employed within information systems; (iv) the types of 
threats facing organizations, missions/business processes, and information systems; and (v) the 
type of information processed, stored, or transmitted by information systems. Articulating the 
underlying assumptions is a key element in the initial risk framing step of the risk management 
process described in NIST Special Publication 800-39. Some of the assumptions that underlie the 
baselines in Appendix D include: 
                                                 
61 The general security control selection process may be augmented or further detailed by additional sector-specific 
guidance as described in Section 3.3, Creating Overlays, and Appendix I, template for developing overlays. 
62 CNSS Instruction 1253 provides security control baselines for national security systems. 
Implementation Tip 
To determine the impact level of an information system: 
• First, determine the different types of information that are processed, stored, or transmitted by the 
information system. NIST Special Publication 800-60 provides common information types. 
• Second, using the impact values in FIPS Publication 199 and the recommendations of NIST 
Special Publication 800-60, categorize the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of each 
information type.   
• Third, determine the information system security categorization, that is, the highest impact value 
for each security objective (confidentiality, integrity, availability) from among the categorizations 
for the information types associated with the information system. 
• Fourth, determine the overall impact level of the information system from the highest impact value 
among the three security objectives in the system security categorization. 
Note: For national security systems, organizations use CNSSI 1253 for security categorization.

                                                                                               and Organizations 
________________________________________________________________________________________________ 
CHAPTER 3   PAGE 30 
• Information systems are located in physical facilities; 
• User data/information in organizational information systems is relatively persistent;63 
• Information systems are multi-user (either serially or concurrently) in operation; 
• Some user data/information in organizational information systems is not shareable with other 
users who have authorized access to the same systems; 
• Information systems exist in networked environments; 
• Information systems are general purpose in nature; and 
• Organizations have the necessary structure, resources, and infrastructure to implement the 
controls.64 
If one or more of these assumptions is not valid, then some of the security controls assigned to the 
initial baselines in Appendix D may not be applicable—a situation that can be readily addressed 
by applying the tailoring guidance in Section 3.2 and the results of organizational assessments of 
risk. Conversely, there are also some possible situations that are specifically not addressed in the 
baselines. These include: 
• Insider threats exist within organizations; 
• Classified data/information is processed, stored, or transmitted by information systems; 
• Advanced persistent threats (APTs) exist within organizations; 
• Selected data/information requires specialized protection based on federal legislation, 
directives, regulations, or policies; and 
• Information systems need to communicate with other systems across different security 
domains. 
If any of the above assumptions apply, then additional security controls from Appendix F would 
likely be needed to ensure adequate protection—a situation that can also be effectively addressed 
by applying the tailoring guidance in Section 3.2 (specifically, security control supplementation) 
and the results of organizational assessments of risk. 
3.2   TAILORING BASELINE SECURITY CONTROLS 
After selecting the initial set of baseline security controls from Appendix D, organizations initiate 
the tailoring process to modify appropriately and align the controls more closely with the specific 
conditions within the organization (i.e., conditions related to organizational missions/business 
functions, information systems, or environments of operation). The tailoring process includes: 
• Identifying and designating common controls in initial security control baselines; 
• Applying scoping considerations to the remaining baseline security controls; 
• Selecting compensating security controls, if needed; 
                                                 
63 Persistent data/information refers to data/information with utility for a relatively long duration (e.g., days, weeks). 
64 In general, federal departments and agencies will satisfy this assumption. The assumption becomes more of an issue 
for nonfederal entities such as municipalities, first responders, and small (business) contractors. Such entities may not 
be large enough or sufficiently resourced to have elements dedicated to providing the range of security capabilities that 
are assumed by the baselines. Organizations consider such factors in their risk-based decisions.

CHAPTER 3   PAGE 31 
• Assigning specific values to organization-defined security control parameters via explicit 
assignment and selection statements; 
• Supplementing baselines with additional security controls and control enhancements, if 
needed; and 
• Providing additional specification information for control implementation, if needed. 
The tailoring process, as an integral part of security control selection and specification, is part of a 
comprehensive organizational risk management process—framing, assessing, responding to, and 
monitoring information security risk. Organizations use risk management guidance to facilitate 
risk-based decision making regarding the applicability of security controls in the security control 
baselines. Ultimately, organizations use the tailoring process to achieve cost-effective, risk-based 
security that supports organizational mission/business needs. Tailoring activities are approved by 
authorizing officials in coordination with selected organizational officials (e.g., risk executive 
[function], chief information officers, senior information security officers, information system 
owners, common control providers) prior to implementing the security controls. Organizations 
have the flexibility to perform the tailoring process at the organization level for all information 
systems (either as a required tailored baseline or as the starting point for system-specific tailoring 
activities), in support of a particular line of business or mission/business process, at the individual 
information system level, or by using a combination of the above.65   
Conversely, organizations do not remove security controls for operational convenience. Tailoring 
decisions regarding security controls should be defensible based on mission/business needs and 
accompanied by explicit risk-based determinations.66 Tailoring decisions, including the specific 
rationale for those decisions, are documented in the security plans for organizational information 
systems. Every security control from the initial set of baseline security controls is accounted for 
either by the organization (e.g., common control provider) or by the information system owner. If 
certain security controls are tailored out, then the associated rationale is recorded in security plans 
(or references/pointers to other relevant documentation are provided) for the information systems 
and approved by the responsible organizational officials as part of the security plan approval 
process.67   
Documenting significant risk management decisions in the security control selection process is 
imperative in order for authorizing officials to have the necessary information to make credible, 
risk-based decisions with regard to the authorization of information systems. Since information 
systems, environments of operation, and personnel associated with the system development life 
cycle are subject to change, providing the assumptions, constraints, and rationale supporting those 
important risk decisions allows for a better understanding in the future of the security state of the 
information systems or environments of operation at the time the original risk decisions were 
made and facilitates identifying changes, when previous risk decisions are revisited.

66 Tailoring decisions can also be based on timing and applicability of selected security controls under certain defined 
conditions. That is, security controls may not apply in every situation or the parameter values for assignment statements 
may change under certain circumstances. Overlays can define these special situations, conditions, or timing-related 
considerations. 
67 The level of detail required in documenting tailoring decisions in the security control selection process is at the 
discretion of organizations and reflects the impact levels of the respective information systems implementing or 
inheriting the controls.

CHAPTER 3   PAGE 32 
Identifying and Designating Common Controls 
Common controls are controls that may be inherited by one or more organizational information 
systems. If an information system inherits a common control, then that system does not need to 
explicitly implement that control—that is, the security capability is being provided by another 
entity. Therefore, when the security controls in Appendix F call for an information system to 
implement or perform a particular security function, it should not be interpreted to mean that all 
systems that are part of larger, more complex systems or all components of a particular system 
need to implement the control or function. Organizational decisions on which security controls 
are designated as common controls may greatly affect the responsibilities of individual system 
owners with regard to the implementation of controls in a particular baseline. Common control 
selection can also affect the overall resource expenditures by organizations (i.e., the greater the 
number of common controls implemented, the greater potential cost savings). 
Applying Scoping Considerations 
Scoping considerations, when applied in conjunction with risk management guidance, provide 
organizations with a more granular foundation with which to make risk-based decisions.68 The 
application of scoping considerations can eliminate unnecessary security controls from the initial 
security control baselines and help to ensure that organizations select only those controls that are 
needed to provide the appropriate level of protection for organizational information systems—
protection based on the missions and business functions being supported by those systems and the 
environments in which the systems operate. Organizations may apply the scoping considerations 
described below to assist with making risk-based decisions regarding security control selection 
and specification—decisions that can potentially affect how the baseline security controls are 
applied and implemented by organizations: 
• CONTROL ALLOCATION AND PLACEMENT CONSIDERATIONS— 
The term information system can refer to systems at multiple levels of abstraction ranging 
from system-of-systems to individual single-user systems. The growing complexity of many 
information systems requires careful analysis in the allocation/placement of security controls 
within the three tiers in the risk management hierarchy (organization level, mission/business 
process level, and information system level) without imposing any specific architectural 
views or solutions.69 Security controls in the initial baselines represent an information 
system-wide set of controls that may not be applicable to every component in the system. 
Security controls are applicable only to information system components that provide or 
support the information security capability addressed by the controls.70 Organizations make 
explicit risk-based decisions about where to apply or allocate specific security controls in 
organizational information systems in order to achieve the needed security capability and to 
satisfy security requirements.71 An example of this type of allocation is applying the 
                                                 
68 The scoping considerations listed in this section are exemplary and not intended to limit organizations in rendering 
risk-based decisions based on other organization-defined considerations with appropriate rationale. 
69 This is especially true with the advent of service-oriented architectures where specific services are provided to 
implement a single function. 
70 For example, auditing controls are typically applied to components of an information system that provide auditing 
capability (e.g., servers, etc.) and are not necessarily applied to every user-level workstation within the organization.  
Organizations should carefully assess the inventory of components that compose their information systems to 
determine which security controls are applicable to the various components. 
71 As information technology advances, more powerful and diverse functionality can be found in smart phones, tablets, 
and other types of mobile devices. While tailor guidance may support not allocating a particular security control to a 
specific technology or device, any residual risk associated with the absence of that control must be addressed in risk 
assessments to adequately protect organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation.

requirement from AC-18 (1) (i.e., protecting wireless access to information systems using 
authentication/encryption) to all wireless access except for wireless access to visitor 
subnetworks which are not connected to other system components. 
• OPERATIONAL/ENVIRONMENTAL-RELATED CONSIDERATIONS— 
Several of the security controls in the baselines are based on the assumption of the existence 
of certain operational/environmental factors. Where these factors are absent or significantly 
diverge from the baseline assumptions, it is justifiable to tailor the baseline. Some of the more 
common operational/environmental factors include: 
- Mobility 
The mobility of physical hosting environments can impact the set of security controls 
selected for organizational information systems. As noted above, the initial set of security 
controls assigned to the baselines in Appendix D assumes the operation of information 
systems in fixed facilities and nonmobile locations. If those information systems operate 
primarily in mobile environments, the initial set of security controls should be tailored 
appropriately to account for the differences in mobility and accessibility of the locations 
where the systems reside. For example, many of the security controls in the Physical and 
Environmental Protection (PE) family that are selected in all initial baselines reflect the 
assumption that the information systems reside in physical facilities/complexes that 
require appropriate physical protections. Such controls would likely not provide added 
value for mobile environments such as ships, aircraft, automobiles, vans, or space-based 
systems.72 
- Single-User Systems and Operations 
For information systems that are designed to operate as single-user systems (e.g., smart 
phones), several of the security controls that address sharing among users may not be 
needed. A single-user system or device refers to a system/device that is only intended to 
be used by a single individual over time (i.e., exclusive use). Systems or devices that are 
shared by multiple users over time are not considered single-user. Security controls such 
as AC-10, Concurrent Session Control, SC-4, Information in Shared Resources, and AC-
3, Access Enforcement73 may not be required in single-user systems/operations and could 
reasonably be tailored out of the baseline at the discretion of organizations. 
- Data Connectivity and Bandwidth 
While many information systems are interconnected, there are some systems which for 
security or operational reasons, lack networking capabilities—that is, the systems are air 
gapped from the network. For nonnetworked systems, security controls such as AC-17, 
Remote Access, SC-8, Transmission Confidentiality and Integrity, and SC-7, Boundary 
Protection, are not applicable and may be tailored out of the security control baselines at 
the discretion of organizations. In addition to nonnetworked information systems, there 
are systems that have very limited or sporadic bandwidth (e.g., tactical systems that 
support warfighter or law enforcement missions). For such systems, the application of 
security controls would need to be examined carefully as the limited and/or sporadic 
bandwidth could impact the practicality of implementing those controls and the viability 
of adversaries staging cyber attacks over the limited bandwidth. 
                                                 
72 The mobile nature of devices means that it is possible that, for some period of time, the devices may reside in fixed 
facilities or complexes in fixed locations. During that time, the PE controls would likely apply. 
73 Organizations consider whether individual users have administrator privileges before removing AC-3 from security 
control baselines.

CHAPTER 3   PAGE 34 
- Limited Functionality Systems or System Components 
What constitutes an information system under the E-Government Act of 2002 is quite 
broad. Fax machines, printers, scanners, pagers, smart phones, tablets, E-readers, and 
digital cameras can all be categorized as information systems (or system components). 
These types of systems and components may lack the general processing capabilities 
assumed in the security control baselines. The nature of these constraints may limit the 
types of threats that these systems face, and hence the appropriateness of some of the 
security controls. Thus, a control such as SI-3, Malicious Code Protection (required in all 
control baselines) may not be practical for information systems or components that are 
not capable of executing code (e.g., text-only pagers). However, because there is often no 
clear delineation between these types of information systems or components (e.g., smart 
phones combine the digital capabilities of telephones, cameras, and computers), it is 
important that the application of security controls to limited functionality systems or 
components be done judiciously and always take into account the intended use of the 
systems, system capabilities, and the risk of compromise. 
- Information and System Non-Persistence 
There is often an assumption that user information within organizational information 
systems is persistent for a considerable period of time. However, for some applications 
and environments of operation (e.g., tactical systems, industrial control systems), the 
persistence of user information is often very limited in duration. For information systems 
processing, storing, or transmitting such non-persistent information, several security 
controls in the Contingency Planning (CP) family such as CP-6, Alternate Storage Site, 
CP-7, Alternate Processing Site, and CP-9, Information System Backup, may not be 
practical and can be tailored out at the discretion of organizations. For similar reasons, 
controls such as MP-6, Media Sanitization, and SC-28, Protection of Information at Rest, 
are good candidates for removal through tailoring.74 In addition to the non-persistence of 
information, the information systems/services may be non-persistent as well. This can be 
achieved by the use of virtualization techniques to establish non-persistent instantiations 
of operating systems and applications. Depending on the duration of the instantiations, 
some baseline controls might not be applicable. 
- Public Access 
When public access to organizational information systems is allowed, security controls 
should be applied with discretion since some security controls from the specified control 
baselines (e.g., identification and authentication, personnel security controls) may not be 
applicable for public access. Thus, in the case of the general public accessing federal 
government websites (e.g., to download publically accessible information such as forms, 
emergency preparedness information), security controls such as AC-7, Unsuccessful 
Logon Attempts, AC-17, Remote Access, IA-2, Identification and Authentication, IA-4, 
Identifier Management, and IA-5, Authenticator Management, typically would not be 
relevant for validating access authorizations or privileges. However, many of these 
controls would still be needed for identifying and authenticating organizational personnel 
that maintain and support information systems providing such public access websites and 
services. Similarly, many of the security controls may still be required for users accessing 
nonpublic information systems through such public interfaces, for example, to access or 
change personal information. 
                                                 
74 Organizations balance information persistence with the sensitivity of the information. Non-persistent information 
may still require sanitization after deletion. In addition, organizations consider the duration of information sensitivity—
some information may be persistent, but only be sensitive for a limited time.

CHAPTER 3   PAGE 35 
• SECURITY OBJECTIVE-RELATED CONSIDERATIONS— 
Security controls that support only one or two of the confidentiality, integrity, or availability 
security objectives may be downgraded to the corresponding control in a lower baseline (or 
modified or eliminated if not defined in a lower baseline) only if the downgrading action: (i) 
reflects the FIPS Publication 199 security category for the supported security objective(s) 
before moving to the FIPS Publication 200 impact level (i.e., high water mark);75 (ii) is 
supported by an organizational assessment of risk; and (iii) does not adversely affect the level 
of protection for the security-relevant information within the information system.76 For 
example, if an information system is categorized as moderate impact using the high water 
mark concept because confidentiality and/or integrity are moderate but availability is low, 
there are several controls that only support the availability security objective and that 
potentially could be downgraded to low baseline requirements—that is, it may be appropriate 
not to implement CP-2 (1) because the control enhancement supports only availability and is 
selected in the moderate baseline but not in the low baseline. The following security controls 
and control enhancements are potential candidates for downgrading:77 
- Confidentiality: AC-21, MA-3 (3), MP-3, MP-4, MP-5, MP-5 (4), MP-6 (1), MP-6 (2), 
PE-4, PE-5, SC-4, SC-8, SC-8 (1); 
- Integrity: CM-5, CM-5 (1), CM-5 (3), SC-8, SC-8 (1), SI-7, SI-7 (1), SI-7 (5), SI-10; and 
- Availability: CP-2 (1), CP-2 (2), CP-2 (3), CP-2 (4), CP-2 (5), CP-2 (8), CP-3 (1), CP-4 
(1), CP-4 (2), CP-6,  CP-6 (1), CP-6 (2), CP-6 (3), CP-7, CP-7 (1), CP-7 (2), CP-7 (3), 
CP-7 (4), CP-8, CP-8 (1), CP-8 (2), CP-8 (3), CP-8 (4), CP-9 (1), CP-9 (2), CP-9 (3), CP-
9 (5), CP-10 (2), CP-10 (4), MA-6, PE-9, PE-10, PE-11, PE-11 (1), PE-13 (1), PE-13 (2), 
PE-13 (3), PE-15 (1).  
• TECHNOLOGY-RELATED CONSIDERATIONS— 
Security controls that refer to specific technologies (e.g., wireless, cryptography, public key 
infrastructure) are applicable only if those technologies are employed or are required to be 
employed within organizational information systems. Security controls that can be explicitly 
or implicitly supported by automated mechanisms do not require the development of such 
mechanisms if the mechanisms do not already exist or are not readily available in commercial 
or government off-the-shelf products. If automated mechanisms are not readily available, 
                                                 
75 When applying the high water mark in Section 3.1, some of the original FIPS Publication 199 confidentiality, 
integrity, or availability security objectives may have been upgraded to a higher security control baseline. As part of 
this process, security controls that uniquely support the confidentiality, integrity, or availability security objectives may 
have been upgraded unnecessarily. Consequently, it is recommended that organizations consider appropriate and 
allowable downgrading actions to ensure cost-effective, risk-based application of security controls. 
76 Information that is security-relevant at the information system level (e.g., password files, network routing tables, 
cryptographic key management information) is distinguished from user-level information within the same system. 
Certain security controls are used to support the security objectives of confidentiality and integrity for both user-level 
and system-level information. Caution should be exercised in downgrading confidentiality or integrity-related security 
controls to ensure that downgrading actions do not result in insufficient protection for the security-relevant information 
within the information system. Security-relevant information must be protected at the high water mark in order to 
achieve a similar level of protection for any of the security objectives related to user-level information. 
77 Downgrading actions apply only to the moderate and high baselines. Security controls that are uniquely attributable 
to confidentiality, integrity, or availability that would ordinarily be considered as potential candidates for downgrading 
(e.g., AC-16, AU-10, IA-7, PE-12, PE-14, SC-5, SC-13, SC-16) are eliminated from consideration because the controls 
are either selected for use in all baselines and have no enhancements that could be downgraded, or the controls are 
optional and not selected for use in any baseline. Organizations should exercise caution when downgrading security 
controls that do not appear in the list in Section 3.2 to ensure that downgrading actions do not affect security objectives 
other than the objectives targeted for downgrading.

CHAPTER 3   PAGE 36 
cost-effective, or technically feasible, compensating security controls, implemented through 
nonautomated mechanisms or procedures, are used to satisfy specified security controls or 
control enhancements (see terms and conditions for applying compensating controls below). 
• MISSION REQUIREMENTS-RELATED CONSIDERATIONS— 
Some security controls may not be applicable (or appropriate) if implementing those controls 
has the potential to degrade, debilitate, or otherwise hamper critical organizational missions 
and/or business functions. For example, if the mission requires that an uninterrupted display 
of mission-critical information be available at an operator console (e.g., air traffic controller 
console), the implementation of AC-11, Session Lock, or SC-10, Network Disconnect, may 
not be appropriate. 
Selecting Compensating Security Controls 
Organizations may find it necessary on occasion to employ compensating security controls. 
Compensating controls are alternative security controls employed by organizations in lieu of 
specific controls in the low, moderate, or high baselines described in Appendix D—controls that 
provide equivalent or comparable protection for organizational information systems and the 
information processed, stored, or transmitted by those systems.78 This may occur, for example, 
when organizations are unable to effectively implement specific security controls in the baselines 
or when, due to the specific nature of the information systems or environments of operation, the 
controls in the baselines are not a cost-effective means of obtaining the needed risk mitigation. 
Compensating controls are typically selected after applying the scoping considerations in the 
tailoring guidance to the initial set of baseline security controls. Compensating controls may be 
employed by organizations under the following conditions: 
• Organizations select compensating controls from Appendix F; if appropriate compensating 
controls are not available, organizations adopt suitable compensating controls from other 
sources;79 
• Organizations provide supporting rationale for how compensating controls provide equivalent 
security capabilities for organizational information systems and why the baseline security 
controls could not be employed; and 
• Organizations assess and accept the risk associated with implementing compensating controls 
in organizational information systems. 
Assigning Security Control Parameter Values 
Security controls and control enhancements containing embedded parameters (i.e., assignment 
and selection statements) give organizations the flexibility to define certain portions of controls 
and enhancements to support specific organizational requirements. After the initial application of 
scoping considerations and the selection of compensating controls, organizations review the 
security controls and control enhancements for assignment/selection statements and determine 
appropriate organization-defined values for the identified parameters. Parameter values may be 
prescribed by applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, or 
standards. Once organizations define the parameter values for security controls and control 
                                                 
78 More than one compensating control may be required to provide the equivalent protection for a particular security 
control in Appendix F. For example, organizations with significant staff limitations may compensate for the separation 
of duty security control by strengthening the audit, accountability, and personnel security controls. 
79 Organizations should make every attempt to select compensating controls from the security control catalog in 
Appendix F. Organization-defined compensating controls are employed only when organizations determine that the 
security control catalog does not contain suitable compensating controls.

CHAPTER 3   PAGE 37 
enhancements, the assignments and selections become a part of the control and enhancement.80 
Organizations may choose to specify the values for security control parameters before selecting 
compensating controls since the specification of the parameters completes the control definitions 
and may affect compensating control requirements. There can also be significant benefits in 
collaborating on the development of parameter values. For organizations that work together on a 
frequent basis, it may be useful for those organizations to develop a mutually agreeable set of 
uniform values for security control parameters. Doing so may assist organizations in achieving a 
greater degree of reciprocity when depending upon the information systems and/or services 
offered by other organizations. 
Supplementing Security Control Baselines 
The final determination of the appropriate set of security controls necessary to provide adequate 
security for organizational information systems and the environments in which those systems 
operate is a function of the assessment of risk and what is required to sufficiently mitigate the 
risks to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation.81  
In many cases, additional security controls or control enhancements (beyond those controls and 
enhancements contained in the baselines in Appendix D) will be required to address specific 
threats to and vulnerabilities in organizations, mission/business processes, and/or information 
systems and to satisfy the requirements of applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, 
policies, standards, or regulations.82 The risk assessment in the security control selection process 
provides essential information in determining the necessity and sufficiency of the security 
controls and control enhancements in the initial baselines. Organizations are encouraged to make 
maximum use of Appendix F to facilitate the process of supplementing the initial baselines with 
additional security controls and/or control enhancements.83 
Situations Requiring Potential Baseline Supplementation 
Organizations may be subject to conditions that, from an operational, environmental, or threat 
perspective, warrant the selection and implementation of additional (supplemental) controls to 
achieve adequate protection of organizational missions/business functions and the information 
systems supporting those missions/functions. Examples of conditions and additional controls that 
might be required are provided below. 
• ADVANCED PERSISTENT THREAT 
Security control baselines do not assume that the current threat environment is one where 
adversaries have achieved a significant foothold and presence within organizations and 
organizational information systems—that is, organizations are dealing with an advanced 
persistent threat (APT). Adversaries continue to attack organizational information systems 
and the information technology infrastructure and are successful in some aspects of such 
attacks. To more fully address the advanced persistent threat, concepts such as insider threat 
                                                 
80 CNSS Instruction 1253 provides assignment of minimum values for organization-defined variables applicable to 
national security systems. Parameter values can also be defined as part of overlays described in Section 3.4. 
81 Considerations for potential national-level impacts and impacts to other organizations in categorizing organizational 
information systems derive from the USA PATRIOT Act and Homeland Security Presidential Directives. 
82 In previous versions of Special Publication 800-53, tailoring referred only to the removal of security controls from 
baselines and supplementation referred only to the addition of controls to baselines. In this document, the term tailoring 
has been redefined to include both the addition of security controls to baselines (i.e., tailoring up) and the removal of 
controls from baselines (i.e., tailoring down). 
83 Security controls and control enhancements selected to supplement baselines are allocated to appropriate information 
system components in the same manner as the control allocations carried out by organizations in the initial baselines.

protection (CM-5 (4)), heterogeneity (SC-29), deception (SC-26 and SC-30), non-persistence 
(SC-25 and SC-34), and segmentation (SC-7 (13)) can be considered. 
• CROSS-DOMAIN SERVICES  
Security control baselines do not assume that information systems have to operate across 
multiple security domains. The baselines assume a flat view of information flows (i.e., the 
same security policies in different domains when information moves across authorization 
boundaries). To address cross-domain services and transactions, some subset of the AC-4 
security control enhancements can be considered to ensure adequate protection of information 
when transferred between information systems with different security policies.  
• MOBILITY 
The use of mobile devices might result in the need for additional security controls and control 
enhancements not selected in the initial baselines. For example, AC-7 (2), which requires the 
purging/wiping of information after an organization-defined number of unsuccessful logon 
attempts, or MP-6 (8), which requires the capability for remote purging/wiping, could be 
selected in order to address the threat of theft or loss of mobile devices. 
• CLASSIFIED INFORMATION 
In some environments, classified and sensitive information84 may be resident on national 
security systems without all users having the necessary authorizations to access all of the 
information. In those situations, additional security controls are required to ensure that 
information requiring strict separation is not accessed by unauthorized users. More stringent 
access controls include, for example, AC-3 (3) and AC-16. When classified information is 
being processed, stored, or transmitted on information systems that are jointly owned by 
multiple entities (e.g., coalition partners in military alliances), more restrictive controls for 
maintenance personnel may be required including, for example, MA-5 (4). 
Processes for Identifying Additional Needed Security Controls 
Organizations can employ a requirements definition approach or a gap analysis approach in 
selecting security controls and control enhancements to supplement initial baselines. In the 
requirements definition approach, organizations obtain specific and credible threat85 information 
(or make reasonable assumptions) about the activities of adversaries with certain capabilities or 
attack potential (e.g., skill levels, expertise, available resources). To effectively withstand cyber 
attacks from adversaries with the stated capabilities or attack potential, organizations strive to 
achieve a certain level of defensive capability or cyber preparedness. Organizations can select 
additional security controls and control enhancements from Appendix F to obtain such defensive 
capability or level of preparedness. In contrast to the requirements definition approach, the gap 
analysis approach begins with an organizational assessment of its current defensive capability or 
level of cyber preparedness. From that initial capability assessment, organizations determine the 
types of threats they can reasonably expect to counter. If the current organizational defensive 
capabilities or levels of cyber preparedness are insufficient, the gap analysis determines the 
required capabilities and levels of preparedness. Organizations subsequently define the security 
controls and control enhancements from Appendix F needed to achieve the desired capabilities or 
cyber-preparedness levels. Both of the approaches described above require timely and accurate 
                                                 
84 The example is illustrative only. CNSS Instruction 1253 provides specific guidance regarding security controls 
required for national security systems.  
85 While this example focuses on threats to information systems from purposeful attacks, the threat space of concern to 
organizations also includes environmental disruptions and human errors.

threat information. It is essential that organizations work with the appropriate threat identification 
component to obtain such information. 
During the tailoring process, organizations consider reevaluating the priority codes from the 
security control baselines to determine if any changes to those priorities are appropriate. This is 
especially important when adding security controls that are not included in any of the baselines, 
because those controls have priority codes of P0. The reevaluation of priority codes can be based 
on organizational assessments of risk or design/developmental decisions related to the security 
architecture or the systems and security engineering process that may require certain sequencing 
in security control implementation. 
Enhancing Information Security without Changing Control Selection 
There may be situations in which organizations cannot apply sufficient security controls within 
their information systems to adequately reduce or mitigate risk (e.g., when using certain types of 
information technologies or employing certain computing paradigms). Therefore, alternative 
strategies are needed to prevent organizational missions/business functions from being adversely 
affected— strategies that consider the mission and business risks resulting from an aggressive use 
of information technology. Restrictions on the types of technologies used and how organizational 
information systems are employed provide an alternative method to reduce or mitigate risk that 
may be used in conjunction with, or instead of, supplemental security controls. Restrictions on the 
use of information systems and specific information technologies may be, in some situations, the 
only practical or reasonable actions organizations can take in order to have the capability to carry 
out assigned missions/business functions in the face of determined adversaries. Examples of use 
restrictions include: 
• Limiting the information that information systems can process, store, or transmit or the 
manner in which organizational missions/business functions are automated; 
• Prohibiting external access to organizational information by removing selected information 
system components from networks (i.e., air gapping); and 
• Prohibiting moderate- or high-impact information on organizational information system 
components to which the public has access, unless an explicit risk determination is made 
authorizing such access. 
Providing Additional Specification Information for Control Implementation 
Since security controls are statements of security capability at higher levels of abstraction, the 
controls may lack sufficient information for successful implementation. Therefore, additional 
detail may be necessary to fully define the intent of a given security control for implementation 
purposes and to ensure that the security requirements related to that control are satisfied. For 
example, additional information may be provided as part of the process of moving from control to 
specification requirement, and may involve refinement of implementation details, refinement of 
scope, or iteration to apply the same control differently to different scopes. Organizations ensure 
that if existing security control information (e.g., selection and assignment statements) is not 
sufficient to fully define the intended application of the control, such information is provided. 
Organizations have the flexibility to determine whether additional detail is included as a part of 
the control statement, in supplemental guidance, or in a separate control addendum section. When 
providing additional detail, organizations are cautioned not to change the intent of the security 
control or modify the original language in the control. The additional implementation information 
can be documented either in security plans or systems and security engineering plans. The type of

Supplemental Guidance:  Cryptographic mechanisms used for the protection of integrity include, 
for example, digital signatures and the computation and application of signed hashes using 
asymmetric cryptography, protecting the confidentiality of the key used to generate the hash, 
and using the public key to verify the hash information. Related control: SC-13. 
Additional implementation detail for SI-7 (6): 
Digital signatures are applied to all traffic for which non-repudiation is required employing

mechanism. 
3.3   CREATING OVERLAYS 
The previous sections described the process of tailoring a set of initial baseline security controls 
to achieve a more focused and relevant security capability for organizations. In certain situations, 
it may be beneficial for organizations to apply tailoring guidance to the baselines to develop a set 
of security controls for community-wide use or to address specialized requirements, technologies, 
or unique missions/environments of operation.86 For example, the federal government may decide 
to establish a governmentwide set of security controls and implementation guidance for: (i) public 
key infrastructure (PKI) systems that could be uniformly applied to all PKI systems implemented 
within federal agencies; (ii) cloud-based information systems that are uniformly applied to all 
federal agencies procuring or implementing cloud services; or (iii) industrial control systems 
(ICSs) at federal facilities producing electric power or controlling environmental systems in 
federal facilities. Alternatively, to address particular communities of interest with specialized 
requirements, the Department of Defense, for example, may decide to establish a set of security 
controls and implementation guidance for its tactical operations and environments by applying 
the tailoring guidance to the standard security control baselines for national security systems to 
achieve more specialized solutions. In each of the above examples, tailored baselines can be 
developed for each information technology area or for the unique circumstances/environments 
and promulgated to large communities of interest—thus achieving standardized security 
capabilities, consistency of implementation, and cost-effective security solutions. 
To address the need for developing community-wide and specialized sets of security controls for 
information systems and organizations, the concept of overlay is introduced. An overlay is a fully 
specified set of security controls, control enhancements, and supplemental guidance derived from 
the application of tailoring guidance in Section 3.2 to security control baselines in Appendix D.87 
Overlays complement the initial security control baselines by: (i) providing the opportunity to add 
or eliminate controls; (ii) providing security control applicability and interpretations for specific 
information technologies, computing paradigms, environments of operation, types of information 
systems, types of missions/operations, operating modes, industry sectors, and statutory/regulatory 
requirements; (iii) establishing community-wide parameter values for assignment and/or selection 
statements in security controls and control enhancements; and (iv) extending the supplemental 
guidance for security controls, where necessary. Organizations typically use the overlay concept 
                                                 
86 This type of tailoring can be conducted at the federal level or by individual organizations. 
87 CNSS Instruction 1253 provides tailoring guidance and security control baselines for national security systems.

________________________________________________________________________________________________ 
CHAPTER 3   PAGE 41 
when there is divergence from the basic assumptions used to create the initial security control 
baselines (see Section 3.1). If organizations are not divergent from the basic assumptions for the 
initial baselines, there is likely no need to create an overlay. Alternatively, the baselines may be 
missing key assumptions which would justify creating an overlay with additional assumptions. 
The full range of tailoring activities can be employed by organizations to provide a disciplined 
and structured approach for developing tailored baselines supporting the areas described above. 
Overlays provide an opportunity to build consensus across communities of interest and develop 
security plans for organizational information systems that have broad-based support for very 
specific circumstances, situations, and/or conditions. Categories of overlays that may be useful 
include, for example: 
• Communities of interest, industry sectors, or coalitions/partnerships (e.g., healthcare, law 
enforcement, intelligence, financial, transportation, energy, allied collaboration/sharing); 
• Information technologies/computing paradigms (e.g., cloud/mobile, PKI, Smart Grid, cross-
domain solutions); 
• Environments of operation (e.g., space, tactical); 
• Types of information systems and operating modes (e.g., industrial/process control systems, 
weapons systems, single-user systems, standalone systems); 
• Types of missions/operations (e.g., counterterrorism, first responders, research, development, 
test, and evaluation); and 
• Statutory/regulatory requirements (e.g., Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, Health 
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, Privacy Act). 
Organizations can effectively use the risk management concepts defined in NIST Special 
Publication 800-39 when developing overlays. The successful development of overlays requires 
the involvement of: (i) information security professionals who understand the specific subject 
area that is the focus of the overlay development effort; and (ii) subject matter experts in the 
overlay area who understand the security controls in Appendix F and the initial baselines in 
Appendix D. The format and structure for developing overlays is provided in Appendix I. 
Multiple overlays can be applied to a single security control baseline. The tailored baselines that 
result from the overlay development process may be more or less stringent than the original 
security control baselines. Risk assessments provide information necessary to determine if the 
risk from implementing the tailored baselines falls within the risk tolerance of the organizations 
or communities of interest developing the overlays. If multiple overlays are employed, it is 
possible that there could be a conflict between the overlays. If the use of multiple overlays results 
in conflicts between the application or removal of security controls, the authorizing official (or 
designee), in coordination with the mission/business owner and/or information owner/steward, 
can resolve the conflict. In general, overlays are intended to reduce the need for ad hoc tailoring 
of baselines by organizations through the selection of a set of controls and control enhancements 
that more closely correspond to common circumstances, situations, and/or conditions. However, 
the use of overlays does not preclude organizations from performing further tailoring to reflect 
organization-specific needs, assumptions, or constraints. Tailoring of overlays is accomplished 
within the constraints defined within the overlay and may require the concurrence/approval of the 
authorizing official or other organization-designated individuals. For example, an overlay created 
for an industrial control system (ICS) may require tailoring for applicability to a specific type of 
ICS and its environment of operation. But it is anticipated that the use of overlays would greatly 
reduce the number and extent of organization-specific ad hoc tailoring.

CHAPTER 3   PAGE 42 
3.4   DOCUMENTING THE CONTROL SELECTION PROCESS 
Organizations document the relevant decisions taken during the security control selection process, 
providing a sound rationale for those decisions. This documentation is essential when examining 
the security considerations for organizational information systems with respect to the potential 
mission/business impact. The resulting set of security controls and the supporting rationale for the 
selection decisions (including any information system use restrictions required by organizations) 
are documented in the security plans. Documenting significant risk management decisions in the 
security control selection process is imperative so that authorizing officials can have access to the 
necessary information to make informed authorization decisions for organizational information 
systems.88 Without such information, the understanding, assumptions, constraints, and rationale 
supporting those risk management decisions will, in all likelihood, not be available when the state 
of the information systems or environments of operation change, and the original risk decisions 
are revisited. Figure 4 summarizes the security control selection process, including the selection 
of initial baselines and the tailoring of the baselines by applying the guidance in Section 3.2. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
FIGURE 4: SECURITY CONTROL SELECTION PROCESS 
Iterative and Dynamic Nature of Security Control Tailoring 
The security control tailoring process described above, while appearing to be sequential in nature, 
can also have an iterative aspect. Organizations may choose to execute the tailoring steps in any 
order based on organizational needs and the information generated from risk assessments. For 
example, some organizations may establish the parameter values for security controls in the initial 
baselines prior to selecting compensating controls. Other organizations may delay completing 
assignment and selection statements in the controls until after the supplementation activities have 
been completed. Organizations may also discover that when fully specifying security controls for 
the intended environments of operation, there may be difficulties that arise which may trigger the 
need for additional (supplemental) controls. Finally, the security control tailoring process is not 
static—that is, organizations revisit the tailoring step as often as needed based on ongoing 
organizational assessments of risk. 
                                                 
88 The security control selection process also applies to common control providers and the authorizing officials 
rendering authorization decisions for common controls deployed within organizations.

CHAPTER 3   PAGE 43 
In addition to the iterative and dynamic nature of the security control tailoring process, there may 
also be side effects as controls are added and removed from the baselines. Security controls in 
Appendix F can have some degree of dependency and functional overlap with other controls. In 
many cases, security controls work together to achieve a security capability. Thus, removing a 
particular security control from a baseline during the tailoring process may have unintended side 
effects (and potentially adverse impacts) on the remaining controls. Alternatively, adding a new 
security control to a baseline during the tailoring process may eliminate or reduce the need for 
certain specific controls because the new control provides a better security capability than the 
capability provided by other controls. For example, if organizations implement SC-30 (2) using 
virtualization techniques to randomly/frequently deploy diverse and changing operating systems 
and applications, this approach could potentially limit the requirement to update the security 
configurations in CM-2 (2). Therefore, the addition or removal of security controls is viewed with 
regard to the totality of the information security needs of the organization and its information 
systems, and not simply with regard to the controls being added or removed. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Other Considerations 
Organizational tailoring decisions are not carried out in a vacuum. While such decisions are 
rightly focused on information security considerations, it is important that the decisions be 
aligned with other risk factors that organizations address routinely. Risk factors such as cost, 
schedule, and performance are considered in the overall determination of which security controls 
to employ in organizational information systems and environments of operation. For example, in 
military command and control systems in which lives may be at stake, the adoption of security 
controls is balanced with operational necessity. With respect to the air traffic control system and 
consoles used by air traffic controllers, the need to access the consoles in real time to control the 
air space outweighs the security need for an AC-11, Session Lock. In short, the security control 
selection process (to include tailoring activities described in Section 3.2) should be integrated into 
the overall risk management process as described in NIST Special Publication 800-39. 
Finally, organizations factor scalability into the security control selection process—that is, 
controls are scalable with regard to the extent/rigor of the implementation. Scalability is guided 
by the FIPS Publication 199 security categorizations and the associated FIPS Publication 200 
impact levels of the information systems where the controls are to be applied. For example, 
contingency plans for high-impact information systems may contain significant amounts of 
Implementation Tip 
In diverging from the security control baselines during the tailoring process, organizations consider 
some very important linkages between various controls and control enhancements. These linkages 
are captured in the selection of controls and enhancements in the baselines and are especially 
significant when developing overlays (described in Section 3.3 and Appendix I). In some instances, 
the linkages are such that it is not meaningful to include a security control or control enhancement 
without some other control or enhancement. The totality of the controls and enhancements provide a 
required security capability. Some linkages are obvious such as the linkage between Mandatory 
Access Control enhancement (AC-3 (3)) and Security Attributes (AC-16). But other linkages may be 
more subtle. This is especially true in the case where the linkage is between security functionality-
related controls and security assurance-related controls as described in Appendix E. For example, it 
is not particularly meaningful to implement AC-3 (3) without also implementing a Reference Monitor 
(AC-25). Organizations are encouraged to pay careful attention to the related controls section of the 
Supplemental Guidance for the security controls to help in identifying such linkages.

implementation detail and be quite lengthy. In contrast, contingency plans for low-impact systems 
may contain considerably less detail and be quite succinct. Organizations use discretion in 
applying the security controls to organizational information systems, giving consideration to the 
scalability factors in particular operational environments. Scaling controls to the appropriate 
system impact level facilitates a more cost-effective, risk-based approach to security control 
implementation—expending only the level of resources necessary to achieve sufficient risk 
mitigation and adequate security. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3.5   NEW DEVELOPMENT AND LEGACY SYSTEMS 
The security control selection process described in this section can be applied to organizational 
information systems from two different perspectives: (i) new development; and (ii) legacy. For 
new development systems, the security control selection process is applied from a requirements 
definition perspective since the systems do not yet exist and organizations are conducting initial 
security categorizations. The security controls included in the security plans for the information 
systems serve as a security specification and are expected to be incorporated into the systems 
during the development and implementation phases of the system development life cycle. In 
contrast, for legacy information systems, the security control selection process is applied from a 
gap analysis perspective when organizations are anticipating significant changes to the systems 
(e.g., during major upgrades, modifications, or outsourcing). Since the information systems 
already exist, organizations in all likelihood have completed the security categorization and 
security control selection processes resulting in the establishment of previously agreed-upon 
security controls in the respective security plans and the implementation of those controls within 
the information systems. Therefore, the gap analysis can be applied in the following manner: 
• First, reconfirm or update as necessary, the security category and impact level for the 
information system based on the types of information that are currently being processed, 
stored, or transmitted by the system. 
• Second, review the existing security plan that describes the security controls that are currently 
employed considering any updates to the security category and information system impact 
level as well as any changes to the organization, mission/business processes, the system, or 
the operational environment. Reassess the risk and revise the security plan as necessary, 
including documenting any additional security controls that would be needed by the system to 
ensure that the risk to organizational operations, organizational assets, individuals, other 
organizations, and the Nation, remains at an acceptable level. 
• Third, implement the security controls described in the updated security plan, document in the 
plan of action and milestones any controls not implemented, and continue with the remaining 
steps in the Risk Management Framework in the same manner as a new development system. 
Implementation Tip 
Maintaining a record of security control selection and control status can be addressed in one or 
multiple documents or security plans. If using multiple documents, consider providing references to 
the necessary information in the relevant documents rather than requiring duplication of information. 
Using references to relevant documentation reduces the amount of time and resources needed by 
organizations to generate such information. Other benefits include greater security awareness and 
understanding of the information system capabilities. Increased security awareness/understanding 
supports more effective integration of information security into organizational information systems.

________________________________________________________________________________________________ 
CHAPTER 3   PAGE 45 
Applying Gap Analyses to External Service Providers 
The gap analysis perspective is also applied when interacting with external service providers. As 
described in Section 2.5, organizations are becoming increasingly reliant on external providers for 
information system services. Using the steps in the gap analysis described above, organizations 
can effectively use the acquisition process and appropriate contractual vehicles to require external 
providers to carry out the security categorization and security control selection steps in the RMF.  
The resulting information can help determine what security controls the external provider either 
has in place or intends to implement for the information system services that are to be provided.  
If a security control deficit exists, the responsibility for adequately mitigating unacceptable risks 
arising from the use of external information system services remains with authorizing officials. In 
such situations, organizations can reduce the organizational risk to an acceptable level by: 
• Using the existing contractual vehicle to require the external provider to meet the additional 
security control requirements established by the organization; 
• Negotiating with the provider for additional security controls if the existing contractual 
vehicle does not provide for such added requirements; 
• Approving the use of compensating controls by the provider; or 
• Employing alternative risk mitigation actions89 within the organizational information system 
when a contract either does not exist or the contract does not provide the necessary leverage 
for organizations to obtain the needed security controls. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                 
89 For example, local policies, procedures, and/or compensating controls could be established by organizations to serve 
as alternative mitigation actions for risks identified in a gap analysis. 
Implementation Tip 
Many organizations operate and maintain complex information systems, often referred to as a 
system-of-systems. Enterprise architecture plays a key part in the security control selection process 
for these types of information systems. Organizations can address the complex system problem by 
dividing the system into two or more subsystems and applying the FIPS 199 security categorization 
and FIPS 200 impact level determination to each subsystem. Applying separate impact levels to 
each subsystem does not change the overall impact level of the information system; rather, it allows 
constituent subsystems to receive a separate allocation of security controls instead of deploying 
higher-impact controls across every subsystem. It is not valid to treat the subsystems as entirely 
independent entities, however, since the subsystems are interdependent and interconnected.  
Organizations develop security architectures to allocate security controls among subsystems 
including monitoring and controlling communications at key internal boundaries within the system 
and provide system-wide controls that meet or exceed the highest information system impact level of 
the constituent subsystems inheriting security capabilities from those controls. Organizations also 
consider that replicated subsystems within complex systems may exhibit common vulnerabilities that 
can be exploited by common threat sources—thereby negating the redundancy that might be relied 
upon as a risk mitigation measure. The impact due to a security incident against one constituent 
subsystem might cascade and impact many subsystems at the same time.

[CNSSI 4009] 
An individual or group within an organization that helps to ensure 
that: (i) security risk-related considerations for individual 
information systems, to include the authorization decisions for 
those systems, are viewed from an organization-wide perspective 
with regard to the overall strategic goals and objectives of the 
organization in carrying out its missions and business functions; 
and (ii) managing risk from individual information systems is 
consistent across the organization, reflects organizational risk 
tolerance, and is considered along with other organizational risks 
affecting mission/business success. 
Risk Management 
[CNSSI 4009, adapted] 
The program and supporting processes to manage information 
security risk to organizational operations (including mission, 
functions, image, reputation), organizational assets, individuals, 
other organizations, and the Nation, and includes: (i) establishing 
the context for risk-related activities; (ii) assessing risk; (iii) 
responding to risk once determined; and (iv) monitoring risk over 
time. 
Risk Mitigation 
[CNSSI 4009] 
Prioritizing, evaluating, and implementing the appropriate risk-
reducing controls/countermeasures recommended from the risk 
management process. 
Risk Monitoring Maintaining ongoing awareness of an organization’s risk 
environment, risk management program, and associated activities 
to support risk decisions.

APPENDIX D 
SECURITY CONTROL BASELINES – SUMMARY 
LOW-IMPACT, MODERATE-IMPACT, AND HIGH-IMPACT INFORMATION SYSTEMS 
his appendix contains the security control baselines that represent the starting point in 
determining the security controls for low-impact, moderate-impact, and high-impact 
information systems.90 The three security control baselines are hierarchical in nature with 
regard to the security controls employed in those baselines.91 If a security control is selected for 
one of the baselines, the family identifier and control number are listed in the appropriate column. 
If a security control is not used in a particular baseline, the entry is marked not selected. Security 
control enhancements, when used to supplement security controls, are indicated by the number of 
the enhancement. For example, an IR-2 (1) in the high baseline entry for the IR-2 security control 
indicates that the second control from the Incident Response family has been selected along with 
control enhancement (1). Some security controls and enhancements in the security control catalog 
are not used in any of the baselines in this appendix but are available for use by organizations if 
needed. This situation occurs, for example, when the results of a risk assessment indicate the need 
for additional security controls or control enhancements in order to adequately mitigate risk to 
organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation.  
Organizations can use the recommended priority code designation associated with each security 
control in the baselines to assist in making sequencing decisions for control implementation (i.e., 
a Priority Code 1 [P1] control has a higher priority for implementation than a Priority Code 2 [P2] 
control; a Priority Code 2 [P2] control has a higher priority for implementation than a Priority 
Code 3 [P3] control, and a Priority Code 0 [P0] indicates the security control is not selected in 
any baseline). This recommended sequencing prioritization helps ensure that security controls 
upon which other controls depend are implemented first, thus enabling organizations to deploy 
controls in a more structured and timely manner in accordance with available resources. The 
implementation of security controls by sequence priority code does not imply any defined level of 
risk mitigation until all controls in the security plan have been implemented. The priority codes 
are used only for implementation sequencing, not for making security control selection decisions. 
Table D-1 summarizes sequence priority codes for the baseline security controls in Table D-2. 
TABLE D-1:  SECURITY CONTROL PRIORITIZATION CODES 
Priority Code Sequencing Action 
Priority Code 1  (P1)             FIRST Implement P1 security controls first. 
Priority Code 2  (P2)             NEXT Implement P2 security controls after implementation of P1 controls. 
Priority Code 3  (P3)             LAST Implement P3 security controls after implementation of P1 and P2 controls. 
Unspecified Priority Code  (P0) NONE Security control not selected in any baseline. 
                                                 
90 A complete description of all security controls is provided in Appendices F and G. In addition, separate documents 
for individual security control baselines (listed as Annexes 1, 2, and 3) are available at http://csrc.nist.gov/publications. 
An online version of the catalog of security controls is also available at http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/800-53/home.  
91 The hierarchical nature applies to the security requirements of each control (i.e., the base control plus all of its 
enhancements) at the low-impact, moderate-impact, and high-impact level in that the control requirements at a 
particular impact level (e.g., CP-4 Contingency Plan Testing—Moderate: CP-4 (1)) meets a stronger set of security 
requirements for that control than the next lower impact level of the same control (e.g., CP-4 Contingency Plan 
Testing—Low: CP-4).

APPENDIX D   PAGE D-10 
Tables D-3 through D-19 provide a more detailed summary of the security controls and control 
enhancements in Appendix F. Each table focuses on a different security control family. Whereas 
Table D-2 includes only those security controls and control enhancements allocated to the three 
security control baselines, Tables D-3 through D-19 include all controls and enhancements for the 
respective security control families. The tables include the following information: (i) the security 
controls and control enhancements that have been selected for the security control baselines as 
indicated by an “x” in the column for the selected baseline;93 (ii) the security controls and control 
enhancements that have not been selected for any security control baseline (i.e., the controls and 
control enhancements available for selection to achieve greater protection) as indicated by blank 
cells in the baseline columns; (iii) the security controls and control enhancements that have been 
withdrawn from Appendix F as indicated by an “x” in the respective withdrawn column; and (iv) 
the security controls and control enhancements that have assurance-related characteristics or 
properties (i.e., assurance-related controls) as indicated by an “x” in the respective assurance 
column. Assurance-related controls are discussed in greater detail in Appendix E to include the 
allocation of such controls to security control baselines (see Tables E-1 through E-3). There is no 
summary table provided for the Program Management (PM) family since PM controls are not 
associated with any particular security control baseline.

ADJUSTMENTS TO SECURITY CONTROL BASELINES 
ALLOCATION OF SECURITY CONTROLS AND ASSIGNMENT OF PRIORITY SEQUENCING CODES 
With each revision to SP 800-53, minor adjustments may occur with the security control baselines 
including, for example, allocating additional controls and/or control enhancements, eliminating 
selected controls/enhancements, and changing sequencing priority codes (P-codes). These changes 
reflect: (i)  the ongoing receipt and analysis of threat information; (ii) the periodic reexamination of 
the initial assumptions that generated the security control baselines; (iii) the desire for common 
security control baseline starting points for national security and non-national security systems to 
achieve community-wide convergence (relying subsequently on specific overlays to describe any 
adjustments from the common starting points); and (iv) the periodic reassessment of priority codes 
to appropriately balance the workload of security control implementation. Over time, as the security 
control catalog expands to address the continuing challenges from a dynamic and growing threat 
space that is increasingly sophisticated, organizations will come to rely to a much greater degree on 
overlays to provide the needed specialization for their security plans.

APPENDIX E 
ASSURANCE AND TRUSTWORTHINESS 
MEASURES OF CONFIDENCE FOR INFORMATION SYSTEMS 
ecurity assurance is a critical aspect in determining the trustworthiness of information 
systems. Assurance is the measure of confidence that the security functions, features, 
practices, policies, procedures, mechanisms, and architecture of organizational information 
systems accurately mediate and enforce established security policies.94 The objective of this 
appendix is: 
• To encourage organizations to include assurance requirements in procurements of 
information systems, system components, and services; 
• To encourage hardware, software, and firmware developers to employ development practices 
that result in more trustworthy information technology products and systems; 
• To encourage organizations to identify, select, and use information technology products that 
have been built with appropriate levels of assurance and to employ sound systems and 
security engineering techniques and methods during the system development life cycle 
process; 
• To reduce information security risk by deploying more trustworthy information technology 
products within critical information systems or system components; and 
• To encourage developers and organizations to obtain on an ongoing basis, assurance evidence 
for maintaining trustworthiness of information systems. 
Minimum security requirements for federal information and information systems are defined in 
FIPS Publication 200. These requirements can be satisfied by selecting, tailoring, implementing, 
and obtaining assurance evidence for the security controls in the low, moderate, or high baselines 
in Appendix D.95 The baselines also include the assurance-related controls for the minimum 
assurance requirements that are generally applicable to federal information and information 
systems.96 However, considering the current threat space and the increasing risk to organizational 
operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation, posed by the advanced 
persistent threat (APT), organizations may choose to implement additional assurance-related 
controls from Appendix F. These additional controls can be selected based on the tailoring 
guidance provided in Section 3.2. Organizations can also consider developing high-assurance 
overlays for critical missions/business functions, specialized environments of operation, and/or 
information technologies (see Section 3.3 and Appendix I). When assurance-related controls 
cannot be satisfied, organizations can propose compensating controls (e.g., procedural/operational 
                                                 
94 Section 2.6 provides an introduction to the concepts of assurance and trustworthiness and how the two concepts are 
related. A trustworthiness model is illustrated in Figure 3. 
95 CNSS Instruction 1253 provides security control baselines for national security systems. Therefore, the assurance-
related controls in the baselines established for the national security community, if so designated, may differ from those 
controls designated in Tables E-1 through E-3. 
96 It is difficult to determine if a given security control baseline from Appendix D provides the assurance needed across 
all information technologies, users, platforms, and organizations. For example, while the use of formal methods might 
be appropriate in a cross-domain product, different assurance techniques might be appropriate for a complex air traffic 
control system or for a web server providing emergency preparedness information from the Department of Homeland 
Security. Still, the existing baselines do have assurance aspects that reflect the minimum assurance that is anticipated to 
be common across all technologies, users, platforms, and organizations.

The following sections provide a description of the assurance-related controls that are included in 
each of the security control baselines in Appendix D. The criteria for whether a security control is 
assurance-related or functionality-related is based on the overall characteristics of the control. In 
general, assurance-related controls are controls that: (i) define processes, procedures, techniques, 
or methodologies for designing and developing information systems and system components (i.e., 
hardware, software, firmware); (ii) provide supporting operational processes including improving 
the quality of systems/components/processes; (iii) produce security evidence from developmental 
or operational activities; (iv) determine security control effectiveness or risk (e.g., audit, testing, 
evaluation, analysis, assessment, verification, validation, monitoring); or (v) improve personnel 
skills, expertise, and understanding (e.g., security awareness/training, incident response training, 
contingency training). 
 
Security controls may be designated as assurance-related controls even when the controls exhibit 
some functional characteristics or properties (e.g., SI-4, Information System Monitoring). The 
distinction between functionality and assurance is less important when describing the assurance-
related controls in the baselines—primarily because the security controls in the three baselines 
after the tailoring process is applied, become part of the security plans for information systems 
and for organizations.97 However, the distinction becomes more important when organizations 
exercise the option of selecting additional security controls to increase the level of assurance (or 
the degree of confidence) in the security functionality and security capability.  
                                                 
97 Organizations are cautioned to carefully examine the assurance-related controls in the baselines during the tailoring 
process, including the development of overlays, to help ensure that controls are not being inadvertently eliminated that 
provide the measures of confidence in the security functionality needed for mission/business protection. 
The New Look for Assurance 
While previous versions of Special Publication 800-53 addressed minimum assurance requirements, 
the focus was on higher-level, more abstract requirements applied to the low, moderate, and high 
baselines. This revision takes a fundamentally different approach to assurance by defining specific 
assurance-related security controls in Appendix F that can be implemented by organizations based 
on the security categorizations of their information systems—making the assurance requirements 
more actionable and providing opportunities for increasing the levels of assurance based on mission 
and business needs, current/projected threats, unique operating environments, or the use of new 
technologies. The identification of specific assurance-related controls in the low, moderate, and high 
baselines in easy-to read tables (Tables E-1, E-2, E-3) helps organizations to quickly define controls 
necessary to satisfy minimum assurance requirements. The optional assurance-related controls in 
Table E-4 provide organizations with specification language to use in acquisitions targeted at the 
developers of information systems, system components, and information system services. The 
controls address specific methodologies, techniques, design, and architectural considerations as 
well as sound system and security engineering principles to fundamentally improve the quality of 
hardware, software, and firmware components that will be integrated into organizational information 
systems or the critical infrastructure. The designation of assurance-related controls is not intended to 
imply a greater level of importance for such controls. Achieving adequate security for organizational 
information systems requires the correct combination of both functionality- and assurance-related 
security controls. Only by understanding the importance of the concept of assurance and recognizing 
which security controls are more assurance-oriented versus functionality-oriented can organizations 
select the most appropriate combination of controls to protect their organizational operations and 
assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation.

APPENDIX E   PAGE E-3 
Minimum Assurance Requirements – Low-Impact Systems 
Assurance Requirement:  The organization, based on its security requirements, security policies, and needed 
security capabilities, has an expectation of: (i) a limited strength of security functionality; and (ii) a limited 
degree of confidence supported by the depth and coverage of associated security evidence, that the security 
functionality is complete, consistent, and correct. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Security functionality and assurance for low-impact systems are achieved by the 
implementation of security controls from the tailored low baseline in Appendix D. Assurance requirements 
for low-impact systems (including the information technology components that are part of those systems), 
align with that which is readily achievable with unmodified, commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) products and 
services. Due to the limited strength of functionality expected for low-impact systems, the depth/coverage 
of security evidence98 produced is minimal and is not expected to be more than what is routinely provided 
by COTS manufacturers, vendors, and resellers. The depth/coverage evidence is further supplemented by 
the results of security control assessments and the ongoing monitoring of organizational information 
systems and environments in which the systems operate. For other than technology-based functionality, the 
emphasis is on a limited degree of confidence in the completeness, correctness, and consistency of 
procedural and/or operational security functionality (e.g., policies, procedures, physical security, and 
personnel security). Assurance requirements specified in the form of developmental and operational 
assurance controls for low-impact systems are listed in Table E-1. Organizations, through the tailoring 
process (including an organizational assessment of risk), may choose to add other assurance-related 
controls and/or control enhancements to the set included in Table E-1.

Minimum Assurance Requirements – Moderate-Impact Systems 
Assurance Requirement:  The organization, based on its security requirements, security policies, and needed 
security capabilities, has an expectation of: (i) a moderate strength of security functionality; and (ii) a 
moderate degree of confidence supported by the depth and coverage of associated security evidence, that 
the security functionality is complete, consistent, and correct. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Security functionality and assurance for moderate-impact systems are achieved by 
the implementation of security controls from the tailored moderate baseline in Appendix D. Assurance 
requirements for moderate-impact systems (including the information technology components that are part 
of those systems) add to the expectations at the low-assurance level by: (i) incorporating COTS security 
functionality with greater strength of mechanism and capability than the strength of mechanism and 
capability achieved in low-impact systems; (ii) requiring perhaps, some special development; (iii) 
establishing more secure configuration settings; and (iv) requiring some additional assessment of the 
implemented capability. Due to the moderate strength of functionality expected for moderate-impact 
systems, the depth/coverage of security evidence100 produced is more substantial than the minimal evidence 
produced for low-impact systems but still in the range of what can be provided by COTS manufacturers, 
vendors, and resellers. The depth/coverage evidence is further supplemented by the results of additional 
security control assessments and the ongoing monitoring of organizational information systems and 
environments of operation. For other than technology-based functionality, the emphasis is on a moderate 
degree of confidence in the completeness, correctness, and consistency of procedural and/or operational 
security functionality (e.g., policies, procedures, physical security, and personnel security). Assurance 
requirements in the form of developmental and operational assurance controls for moderate-impact systems 
are listed in Table E-2. Organizations, through the tailoring process (including an organizational assessment 
of risk), may choose to add other assurance-related controls and/or control enhancements to the set 
included in Table E-2.

Minimum Assurance Requirements – High-Impact Systems 
Assurance Requirement:  The organization, based on its security requirements, security policies, and needed 
security capabilities, has an expectation of: (i) a high strength of security functionality; and (ii) a high 
degree of confidence supported by the depth and coverage of associated security evidence, that the security 
functionality is complete, consistent, and correct. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Security functionality and assurance for high-impact systems are achieved by the 
implementation of security controls from the tailored high baseline in Appendix D. Assurance requirements 
for high-impact systems (including the information technology components that are part of those systems), 
add to the expectations at the moderate assurance level by: (i) incorporating higher-end COTS security 
capabilities that result from the application of commonly accepted best commercial development practices 
for reducing latent flaw rates, some special development, and additional assessment of the implemented 
capability. Due to the high strength of functionality expected for high-impact systems, the depth/coverage 
of security evidence102 produced is more comprehensive than the evidence produced for moderate-impact 
systems. Although the evidence may still be in the range of what can be provided by COTS manufacturers, 
vendors, and resellers, greater assurance from independent assessment providers may be required. The 
depth/coverage evidence is supplemented by the results of additional security control assessments and the 
ongoing monitoring of organizational information systems/environments of operation. For other than 
technology-based functionality, there is a high degree of confidence in the completeness, correctness, and 
consistency of procedural and/or operational security functionality (e.g., policies, procedures, physical 
security, and personnel security). Assurance requirements in the form of developmental and operational 
assurance controls for high-impact information systems are listed in Table E-3. Organizations, through the 
tailoring process (including an organizational assessment of risk), may choose to add other assurance-
related controls and/or control enhancements to the set included in Table E-3.

APPENDIX E   PAGE E-6 
Security Controls to Achieve Enhanced Assurance 
While the assurance-related controls allocated to the low, moderate, and high baselines in the 
previous sections, represent minimum assurance requirements, organizations can, over time, 
choose to raise the level of assurance in their information systems—increasing the level of 
trustworthiness accordingly. This is accomplished by adding assurance-related controls to the 
controls in the baselines to increase both the strength of security functionality and degree of 
confidence that the functionality is correct, complete, and consistent—making the functionality 
highly resistant to penetration, tamper, or bypass. Security functionality that is highly resistant to 
penetration, tamper, and bypass requires a significant work factor on the part of adversaries to 
compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the information system or system 
components where that functionality is employed. 
Since high-assurance information technology products may be more costly and difficult to obtain, 
organizations may choose to partition their information systems into distinct subsystems to isolate 
the critical components and focus the high-assurance efforts on a more narrowly defined subset of 
information resources. Organizations that find it difficult to achieve high-assurance information 
technology solutions may have to rely to a greater extent on procedural or operational protections 
to ensure mission and business success. This includes, for example, reengineering critical mission 
and business processes to be less susceptible to high-end threats. Table E-4 provides additional 
developmental and operational activities (e.g., in the SA, SI, and CM security control families), 
that organizations can select to achieve an enhanced level of assurance (up to and including high 
assurance). The list of assurance-related controls is not intended to be exhaustive. Organizations, 
during the tailoring process, may choose to designate other security controls as assurance-related 
and add to the exemplar set in Table E-4.

levels of assurance (i.e., the controls needed to go beyond the minimum assurance levels that are represented by the 
assurance-related controls in Tables E-1, E-2, and E-3). When an assurance-related control is allocated to a baseline 
(i.e., listed in Tables E-1, E-2, or E-3), but all of its control enhancements are in Table E-4, it is designated in the table 
as Control (all enhancements). When an assurance-related control and all of its control enhancements are not allocated 
to baselines, it is designated in the table as Control (plus enhancements). When assurance-related control enhancements 
from a particular control are allocated to one of the baselines, the remaining unselected control enhancements are listed 
individually in Table E-4.

APPENDIX F 
SECURITY CONTROL CATALOG  
SECURITY CONTROLS, ENHANCEMENTS, AND SUPPLEMENTAL GUIDANCE 
he catalog of security controls in this appendix provides a range of safeguards and 
countermeasures for organizations and information systems.105 The security controls have 
been designed to facilitate compliance with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, 
directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidelines.106 The organization of the security 
control catalog, the structure of the security controls, and the concept of allocating security 
controls and control enhancements to the initial baselines in Appendix D are described in Chapter 
Two. The security controls in the catalog with few exceptions, have been designed to be policy- 
and technology-neutral. This means that security controls and control enhancements focus on the 
fundamental safeguards and countermeasures necessary to protect information during processing, 
while in storage, and during transmission. Therefore, it is beyond the scope of this publication to 
provide guidance on the application of security controls to specific technologies, communities of 
interest, environments of operation, or missions/business functions. These areas are addressed by 
the use of the tailoring process described in Chapter Three and the development of overlays 
described in Appendix I. 
In the few cases where specific technologies are called out in security controls (e.g., mobile, PKI, 
wireless, VOIP), organizations are cautioned that the need to provide adequate security goes well 
beyond the requirements in a single control associated with a particular technology. Many of the 
needed safeguards/countermeasures are obtained from the other security controls in the catalog 
allocated to the initial control baselines as the starting point for the development of security plans 
and overlays using the tailoring process. In addition to the organization-driven development of 
specialized security plans and overlays, NIST Special Publications and Interagency Reports may 
provide guidance on recommended security controls for specific technologies and sector-specific 
applications (e.g., Smart Grid, healthcare, Industrial Control Systems, and mobile). 
Employing a policy- and technology-neutral security control catalog has the following benefits: 
• It encourages organizations to focus on the security capabilities required for mission/business 
success and the protection of information, irrespective of the information technologies that 
are employed in organizational information systems; 
• It encourages organizations to analyze each security control for its applicability to specific 
technologies, environments of operation, missions/business functions, and communities of 
interest; and 
                                                 
105 An online version of the catalog of security controls is also available at http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/800-53/home. 
106 Compliance necessitates organizations executing due diligence with regard to information security and risk 
management. Information security due diligence includes using all appropriate information as part of an organization-
wide risk management program to effectively use the tailoring guidance and inherent flexibility in NIST publications so 
that the selected security controls documented in organizational security plans meet the specific mission and business 
requirements of organizations. Using the risk management tools and techniques that are available to organizations is 
essential in developing, implementing, and maintaining the safeguards and countermeasures with the necessary and 
sufficient strength of mechanism to address the current threats to organizational operations and assets, individuals, 
other organizations, and the Nation. Employing effective risk-based processes, procedures, and technologies will help 
ensure that all federal information systems and organizations have the necessary resilience to support ongoing federal 
responsibilities, critical infrastructure applications, and continuity of government.

APPENDIX F   PAGE F-2 
• It encourages organizations to specify security policies as part of the tailoring process for 
security controls that have variable parameters. 
For example, organizations using smart phones, tablets, or other types of mobile devices would 
start the tailoring process by assuming that all security controls and control enhancements in the 
appropriate baseline (low, moderate, or high) are needed. The tailoring process may result in 
certain security controls being eliminated for a variety of reasons, including, for example, the 
inability of the technology to support the implementation of the control. However, the elimination 
of such controls without understanding the potential adverse impacts to organizational missions 
and business functions can significantly increase information security risk and should be carefully 
analyzed. This type of analysis is essential in order for organizations to make effective risk-based 
decisions including the selection of appropriate compensating security controls, when considering 
the use of these emerging mobile devices and technologies. The specialization of security plans 
using the tailoring guidance and overlays, together with a comprehensive set of technology- and 
policy-neutral security controls, promotes cost-effective, risk-based information security for 
organizations—in any sector, for any technology, and in any operating environment. 
The security controls in the catalog are expected to change over time, as controls are withdrawn, 
revised, and added. In order to maintain stability in security plans and automated tools supporting 
the implementation of Special Publication 800-53, security controls will not be renumbered each 
time a control is withdrawn. Rather, notations of security controls that have been withdrawn are 
maintained in the catalog for historical purposes. Security controls are withdrawn for a variety of 
reasons including, for example: the security capability provided by the withdrawn control has 
been incorporated into another control; the security capability provided by the withdrawn control 
is redundant to an existing control; or the security control is deemed to be no longer necessary. 
There may, on occasion, be repetition in requirements that appear in the security controls and 
control enhancements that are part of the security control catalog. This repetition in requirements 
is intended to reinforce the security requirements from the perspective of multiple controls and/or 
enhancements. For example, the requirement for strong identification and authentication when 
conducting remote maintenance activities appears in the MA family in the specific context of 
systems maintenance activities conducted by organizations. The identification and authentication 
requirement also appears in a more general context in the IA family. While these requirements 
appear to be redundant (i.e., overlapping), they are, in fact, mutually reinforcing and not intended 
to require additional effort on the part of organizations in the development and implementation of 
security programs. 
  
Implementation Tip 
New security controls and control enhancements will be developed on a regular basis using state-of-
the-practice information from national-level threat and vulnerability databases as well as information 
on the tactics, techniques, and procedures employed by adversaries in launching cyber attacks. The 
proposed modifications to security controls and security control baselines will be carefully weighed 
during each revision cycle, considering the desire for stability of the security control catalog and the 
need to respond to changing threats, vulnerabilities, attack methods, and information technologies. 
The overall objective is to raise the basic level of information security over time. Organizations may 
choose to develop new security controls when there is a specific security capability required and the 
appropriate controls are not available in Appendices F or G.

SECURITY CONTROL CLASS DESIGNATIONS 
MANAGEMENT, OPERATIONAL, AND TECHNICAL REFERENCES 
Because many security controls within the security control families in Appendix F have various 
combinations of management, operational, and technical properties, the specific class designations 
have been removed from the security control families. Organizations may still find it useful to 
apply such designations to individual security controls and control enhancements or to individual 
sections within a particular control/enhancement. Organizations may find it beneficial to employ 
class designations as a way to group or refer to security controls. The class designations may also 
help organizations with the process of allocating security controls and control enhancements to: (i) 
responsible parties or information systems (e.g., as common or hybrid controls); (ii) specific roles; 
and/or (iii) specific components of a system. For example, organizations may determine that the 
responsibility for system-specific controls they have placed in the management class belong to the 
information system owner, controls placed in the operational class belong to the Information 
System Security Officer (ISSO), and controls placed in the technical class belong to one or more 
system administrators. This example is provided to illustrate the potential usefulness of designating 
classes for controls and/or control enhancements; it is not meant to suggest or require additional 
tasks for organizations.

CAUTIONARY NOTE 
DEVELOPMENT OF SYSTEMS, COMPONENTS, AND SERVICES 
With the renewed emphasis on trustworthy information systems and supply chain security, it is 
essential that organizations have the capability to express their information security requirements 
with clarity and specificity in order to engage the information technology industry and obtain the 
systems, components, and services necessary for mission and business success. To ensure that 
organizations have such capability, Special Publication 800-53 provides a set of security controls in 
the System and Services Acquisition family (i.e., SA family) addressing requirements for the 
development of information systems, information technology products, and information system 
services. Therefore, many of the controls in the SA family are directed at developers of those 
systems, components, and services. It is important for organizations to recognize that the scope of 
the security controls in the SA family includes all system/component/service development and the 
developers associated with such development whether the development is conducted by internal 
organizational personnel or by external developers through the contracting/acquisition process. 
Affected controls include SA-8, SA-10, SA-11, SA-15, SA-16, SA-17, SA-20, and SA-21.

APPENDIX F   PAGE F-5 
Fundamentals of the Catalog 
Security controls and control enhancements in Appendices F and G are generally designed to be 
policy-neutral and technology/implementation-independent. Organizations provide information 
about security controls and control enhancements in two ways: 
• By specifying security control implementation details (e.g., platform dependencies) in the 
associated security plan for the information system or security program plan for the 
organization; and 
• By establishing specific values in the variable sections of selected security controls through the 
use of assignment and selection statements. 
Assignment and selection statements provide organizations with the capability to specialize 
security controls and control enhancements based on organizational security requirements or 
requirements originating in federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, 
standards, or guidelines. Organization-defined parameters used in assignment and selection 
statements in the basic security controls apply also to all control enhancements associated with 
those controls. Control enhancements strengthen the fundamental security capability in the base 
control but are not a substitute for using assignment or selection statements to provide greater 
specificity to the control. Assignment statements for security controls and control enhancements 
do not contain minimum or maximum values (e.g., testing contingency plans at least annually). 
Organizations should consult specific federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, 
policies, standards, or guidelines as the definitive sources for such information. The absence of 
minimum and maximum values from the security controls and control enhancements does not 
obviate the need for organizations to comply with requirements in the controlling source 
publications. 
The first security control in each family (i.e., the dash-1 control) generates requirements for 
specific policies and procedures that are needed for the effective implementation of the other 
security controls in the family. Therefore, individual controls and control enhancements in a 
particular family do not call for the development of such policies and procedures. Supplemental 
guidance sections of security controls and control enhancements do not contain any requirements 
or references to FIPS or NIST Special Publications. NIST publications are, however, included in 
a references section for each security control.  
In support of the Joint Task Force initiative to develop a unified information security framework 
for the federal government, security controls and control enhancements for national security 
systems are included in this appendix. The inclusion of such controls and enhancements is not 
intended to impose security requirements on organizations that operate national security systems. 
Rather, organizations can use the security controls and control enhancements on a voluntary basis 
with the approval of federal officials exercising policy authority over national security systems. In 
addition, the security control priorities and security control baselines listed in Appendix D and in 
the priority and baseline allocation summary boxes below each security control in Appendix F, 
apply to non-national security systems only unless otherwise directed by the federal officials with 
national security policy authority.

Using the Catalog 
Organizations employ security controls107 in federal information systems and the environments in 
which those systems operate in accordance with FIPS Publication 199, FIPS Publication 200, and 
NIST Special Publications 800-37 and 800-39. Security categorization of federal information and 
information systems, as required by FIPS Publication 199, is the first step in the risk management 
process.108 Next, organizations select an appropriate set of security controls for their information 
systems by satisfying the minimum security requirements set forth in FIPS Publication 200. 
Appendix D includes three security control baselines that are associated with the designated 
impact levels of information systems as determined during the security categorization process.109 
After baseline selection, organizations tailor the baselines by: (i) identifying/designating common 
controls; (ii) applying scoping considerations; (iii) selecting compensating controls, if needed; 
(iv) assigning control parameter values in selection and assignment statements; (v) supplementing 
the baseline controls with additional controls and control enhancements from the security control 
catalog; and (vi) providing additional information for control implementation. Organizations can 
also use the baseline tailoring process with the overlay concept that is described in Section 3.2 
and Appendix I. Risk assessments, as described in NIST Special Publication 800-30, guide and 
inform the security control selection process.110 
 
 
                                                 
107 The security controls in Special Publication 800-53 are available online and can be downloaded in various formats 
from the NIST web site at: http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/800-53/home. 
108 CNSS Instruction 1253 provides guidance for security categorization of national security systems. 
109 CNSS Instruction 1253 provides guidance on security control baselines for national security systems and specific 
tailoring requirements associated with such systems. 
110 There are additional security controls and control enhancements that appear in the catalog that are not used in any of 
the initial baselines. These additional controls and control enhancements are available to organizations and can be used 
in the tailoring process to achieve the needed level of protection in accordance with organizational risk assessments. 
CAUTIONARY NOTE 
USE OF CRYPTOGRAPHY 
If cryptography is required for the protection of information based on the selection of security 
controls in Appendix F and subsequently implemented by organizational information systems, the 
cryptographic mechanisms comply with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, 
policies, regulations, standards, and guidance. This includes, for NSA-approved cryptography to 
protect classified information, FIPS-validated cryptography to protect unclassified information, and 
NSA-approved and FIPS-compliant key management technologies and processes. Security controls 
SC-12 and SC-13 provide specific information on the selection of appropriate cryptographic 
mechanisms, including the strength of such mechanisms.

FAMILY:  ACCESS CONTROL 
AC-1 ACCESS CONTROL POLICY AND PROCEDURES 
Control:  The organization: 
a. Develops, documents, and disseminates to [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or 
roles]: 
1. An access control policy that addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, 
management commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and compliance; 
and 
2. Procedures to facilitate the implementation of the access control policy and associated 
access controls; and 
b. Reviews and updates the current: 
1. Access control policy [Assignment: organization-defined frequency]; and 
2. Access control procedures [Assignment: organization-defined frequency]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  This control addresses the establishment of policy and procedures for the 
effective implementation of selected security controls and control enhancements in the AC family. 
Policy and procedures reflect applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, 
policies, standards, and guidance. Security program policies and procedures at the organization 
level may make the need for system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The policy can 
be included as part of the general information security policy for organizations or conversely, can 
be represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex nature of certain organizations. The 
procedures can be established for the security program in general and for particular information 
systems, if needed. The organizational risk management strategy is a key factor in establishing 
policy and procedures. Related control: PM-9.

h. Notifies account managers: 
1. When accounts are no longer required; 
2. When users are terminated or transferred; and 
3. When individual information system usage or need-to-know changes; 
i. Authorizes access to the information system based on: 
1. A valid access authorization; 
2. Intended system usage; and 
3. Other attributes as required by the organization or associated missions/business functions; 
j. Reviews accounts for compliance with account management requirements [Assignment: 
organization-defined frequency]; and 
k. Establishes a process for reissuing shared/group account credentials (if deployed) when 
individuals are removed from the group. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Information system account types include, for example, individual, shared, 
group, system, guest/anonymous, emergency, developer/manufacturer/vendor, temporary, and 
service. Some of the account management requirements listed above can be implemented by 
organizational information systems. The identification of authorized users of the information 
system and the specification of access privileges reflects the requirements in other security 
controls in the security plan. Users requiring administrative privileges on information system 
accounts receive additional scrutiny by appropriate organizational personnel (e.g., system owner, 
mission/business owner, or chief information security officer) responsible for approving such 
accounts and privileged access. Organizations may choose to define access privileges or other 
attributes by account, by type of account, or a combination of both. Other attributes required for 
authorizing access include, for example, restrictions on time-of-day, day-of-week, and point-of-
origin. In defining other account attributes, organizations consider system-related requirements 
(e.g., scheduled maintenance, system upgrades) and mission/business requirements, (e.g., time 
zone differences, customer requirements, remote access to support travel requirements). Failure to 
consider these factors could affect information system availability. Temporary and emergency 
accounts are accounts intended for short-term use. Organizations establish temporary accounts as a 
part of normal account activation procedures when there is a need for short-term accounts without 
the demand for immediacy in account activation. Organizations establish emergency accounts in 
response to crisis situations and with the need for rapid account activation. Therefore, emergency 
account activation may bypass normal account authorization processes. Emergency and temporary 
accounts are not to be confused with infrequently used accounts (e.g., local logon accounts used 
for special tasks defined by organizations or when network resources are unavailable). Such 
accounts remain available and are not subject to automatic disabling or removal dates. Conditions 
for disabling or deactivating accounts include, for example: (i) when shared/group, emergency, or 
temporary accounts are no longer required; or (ii) when individuals are transferred or terminated. 
Some types of information system accounts may require specialized training. Related controls:

Control Enhancements: 
(1) ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT | AUTOMATED SYSTEM ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT 
The organization employs automated mechanisms to support the management of information 
system accounts. 
Supplemental Guidance:  The use of automated mechanisms can include, for example: using 
email or text messaging to automatically notify account managers when users are terminated 
or transferred; using the information system to monitor account usage; and using telephonic 
notification to report atypical system account usage.

(2) ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT | REMOVAL OF TEMPORARY / EMERGENCY ACCOUNTS 
The information system automatically [Selection: removes; disables] temporary and emergency 
accounts after [Assignment: organization-defined time period for each type of account]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  This control enhancement requires the removal of both temporary and 
emergency accounts automatically after a predefined period of time has elapsed, rather than at 
the convenience of the systems administrator. 
(3) ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT | DISABLE INACTIVE ACCOUNTS  
The information system automatically disables inactive accounts after [Assignment: organization-
defined time period]. 
(4) ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT | AUTOMATED AUDIT ACTIONS 
The information system automatically audits account creation, modification, enabling, disabling, 
and removal actions, and notifies [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Related controls: AU-2, AU-12. 
(5) ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT | INACTIVITY LOGOUT 
The organization requires that users log out when [Assignment: organization-defined time-period 
of expected inactivity or description of when to log out]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Related control: SC-23. 
(6) ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT | DYNAMIC PRIVILEGE MANAGEMENT 
The information system implements the following dynamic privilege management capabilities: 
[Assignment: organization-defined list of dynamic privilege management capabilities]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  In contrast to conventional access control approaches which employ 
static information system accounts and predefined sets of user privileges, dynamic access 
control approaches (e.g., service-oriented architectures) rely on run time access control 
decisions facilitated by dynamic privilege management. While user identities may remain 
relatively constant over time, user privileges may change more frequently based on ongoing 
mission/business requirements and operational needs of organizations. Dynamic privilege 
management can include, for example, the immediate revocation of privileges from users, as 
opposed to requiring that users terminate and restart their sessions to reflect any changes in 
privileges. Dynamic privilege management can also refer to mechanisms that change the 
privileges of users based on dynamic rules as opposed to editing specific user profiles. This 
type of privilege management includes, for example, automatic adjustments of privileges if 
users are operating out of their normal work times, or if information systems are under duress 
or in emergency maintenance situations. This control enhancement also includes the ancillary 
effects of privilege changes, for example, the potential changes to encryption keys used for 
communications. Dynamic privilege management can support requirements for information 
system resiliency. Related control: AC-16. 
(7) ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT | ROLE-BASED SCHEMES 
The organization: 
(a) Establishes and administers privileged user accounts in accordance with a role-based access 
scheme that organizes allowed information system access and privileges into roles; 
(b) Monitors privileged role assignments; and 
(c) Takes [Assignment: organization-defined actions] when privileged role assignments are no 
longer appropriate. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Privileged roles are organization-defined roles assigned to individuals 
that allow those individuals to perform certain security-relevant functions that ordinary users 
are not authorized to perform. These privileged roles include, for example, key management, 
account management, network and system administration, database administration, and web 
administration. 
(8) ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT | DYNAMIC ACCOUNT CREATION 
The information system creates [Assignment: organization-defined information system accounts] 
dynamically. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Dynamic approaches for creating information system accounts (e.g., as 
implemented within service-oriented architectures) rely on establishing accounts (identities) at

of information system accounts by establishing trust relationships and mechanisms with the 
appropriate authorities to validate related authorizations and privileges. Related control: AC-

(9) ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT | RESTRICTIONS ON USE OF SHARED GROUPS / ACCOUNTS 
The organization only permits the use of shared/group accounts that meet [Assignment: 
organization-defined conditions for establishing shared/group accounts]. 
(10) ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT | SHARED / GROUP ACCOUNT CREDENTIAL TERMINATION 
The information system terminates shared/group account credentials when members leave the 
group. 
(11) ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT | USAGE CONDITIONS 
The information system enforces [Assignment: organization-defined circumstances and/or usage 
conditions] for [Assignment: organization-defined information system accounts]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Organizations can describe the specific conditions or circumstances 
under which information system accounts can be used, for example, by restricting usage to 
certain days of the week, time of day, or specific durations of time. 
(12) ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT | ACCOUNT MONITORING / ATYPICAL USAGE 
The organization: 
(a) Monitors information system accounts for [Assignment: organization-defined atypical use]; 
and 
(b) Reports atypical usage of information system accounts to [Assignment: organization-defined 
personnel or roles]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Atypical usage includes, for example, accessing information systems 
at certain times of the day and from locations that are not consistent with the normal usage 
patterns of individuals working in organizations. Related control: CA-7. 
(13) ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT | DISABLE ACCOUNTS FOR HIGH-RISK INDIVIDUALS 
The organization disables accounts of users posing a significant risk within [Assignment: 
organization-defined time period] of discovery of the risk. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Users posing a significant risk to organizations include individuals for 
whom reliable evidence or intelligence indicates either the intention to use authorized access 
to information systems to cause harm or through whom adversaries will cause harm. Harm 
includes potential adverse impacts to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other 
organizations, or the Nation. Close coordination between authorizing officials, information 
system administrators, and human resource managers is essential in order for timely execution 
of this control enhancement. Related control: PS-4.

AC-3 ACCESS ENFORCEMENT 
Control:  The information system enforces approved authorizations for logical access to information 
and system resources in accordance with applicable access control policies. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Access control policies (e.g., identity-based policies, role-based policies, 
attribute-based policies) and access enforcement mechanisms (e.g., access control lists, access 
control matrices, cryptography) control access between active entities or subjects (i.e., users or 
processes acting on behalf of users) and passive entities or objects (e.g., devices, files, records, 
domains) in information systems. In addition to enforcing authorized access at the information 
system level and recognizing that information systems can host many applications and services in 
support of organizational missions and business operations, access enforcement mechanisms can

Control Enhancements: 
(1) ACCESS ENFORCEMENT | RESTRICTED ACCESS TO PRIVILEGED FUNCTIONS  
[Withdrawn: Incorporated into AC-6]. 
(2) ACCESS ENFORCEMENT | DUAL AUTHORIZATION 
The information system enforces dual authorization for [Assignment: organization-defined 
privileged commands and/or other organization-defined actions]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Dual authorization mechanisms require the approval of two authorized 
individuals in order to execute. Organizations do not require dual authorization mechanisms 
when immediate responses are necessary to ensure public and environmental safety. Related 
controls: CP-9, MP-6. 
(3) ACCESS ENFORCEMENT | MANDATORY ACCESS CONTROL 
The information system enforces [Assignment: organization-defined mandatory access control 
policies] over all subjects and objects where the policy specifies that: 
(a) The policy is uniformly enforced across all subjects and objects within the boundary of the 
information system;  
(b) A subject that has been granted access to information is constrained from doing any of the 
following; 
(1) Passing the information to unauthorized subjects or objects; 
(2) Granting its privileges to other subjects;  
(3) Changing one or more security attributes on subjects, objects, the information system, or 
information system components; 
(4) Choosing the security attributes and attribute values to be associated with newly created 
or modified objects; or 
(5) Changing the rules governing access control; and 
(c) [Assignment: Organized-defined subjects] may explicitly be granted [Assignment: 
organization-defined privileges (i.e., they are trusted subjects)] such that they are not limited 
by some or all of the above constraints.  
Supplemental Guidance:  Mandatory access control as defined in this control enhancement is 
synonymous with nondiscretionary access control, and is not constrained only to certain 
historical uses (e.g., implementations using the Bell-LaPadula Model). The above class of 
mandatory access control policies constrains what actions subjects can take with information 
obtained from data objects for which they have already been granted access, thus preventing 
the subjects from passing the information to unauthorized subjects and objects. This class of 
mandatory access control policies also constrains what actions subjects can take with respect 
to the propagation of access control privileges; that is, a subject with a privilege cannot pass 
that privilege to other subjects. The policy is uniformly enforced over all subjects and objects 
to which the information system has control. Otherwise, the access control policy can be 
circumvented. This enforcement typically is provided via an implementation that meets the 
reference monitor concept (see AC-25). The policy is bounded by the information system 
boundary (i.e., once the information is passed outside of the control of the system, additional 
means may be required to ensure that the constraints on the information remain in effect). The 
trusted subjects described above are granted privileges consistent with the concept of least 
privilege (see AC-6). Trusted subjects are only given the minimum privileges relative to the 
above policy necessary for satisfying organizational mission/business needs. The control is 
most applicable when there is some policy mandate (e.g., law, Executive Order, directive, or 
regulation) that establishes a policy regarding access to sensitive/classified information and 
some users of the information system are not authorized access to all sensitive/classified 
information resident in the information system. This control can operate in conjunction with 
AC-3 (4). A subject that is constrained in its operation by policies governed by this control is 
still able to operate under the less rigorous constraints of AC-3 (4), but policies governed by 
Special Publication 800-53 Revision 4                                  Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems 
                                                                                               and Organizations 
________________________________________________________________________________________________ 
APPENDIX F-AC   PAGE F-12 
this control take precedence over the less rigorous constraints of AC-3 (4). For example, 
while a mandatory access control policy imposes a constraint preventing a subject from 
passing information to another subject operating at a different sensitivity label, AC-3 (4) 
permits the subject to pass the information to any subject with the same sensitivity label as the 
subject. Related controls: AC-25, SC-11. 
(4) ACCESS ENFORCEMENT | DISCRETIONARY ACCESS CONTROL  
The information system enforces [Assignment: organization-defined discretionary access control 
policies] over defined subjects and objects where the policy specifies that a subject that has been 
granted access to information can do one or more of the following: 
(a) Pass the  information to any other subjects or objects; 
(b) Grant its privileges to other subjects;  
(c) Change security attributes on subjects, objects, the information system, or the information 
system’s components; 
(d) Choose the security attributes to be associated with newly created or revised objects; or 
(e) Change the rules governing access control. 
Supplemental Guidance:  When discretionary access control policies are implemented, subjects 
are not constrained with regard to what actions they can take with information for which they 
have already been granted access. Thus, subjects that have been granted access to information 
are not prevented from passing (i.e., the subjects have the discretion to pass) the information 
to other subjects or objects. This control enhancement can operate in conjunction with AC-3 
(3). A subject that is constrained in its operation by policies governed by AC-3 (3) is still able 
to operate under the less rigorous constraints of this control enhancement. Thus, while AC-3 
(3) imposes constraints preventing a subject from passing information to another subject 
operating at a different sensitivity level, AC-3 (4) permits the subject to pass the information 
to any subject at the same sensitivity level. The policy is bounded by the information system 
boundary. Once the information is passed outside of the control of the information system, 
additional means may be required to ensure that the constraints remain in effect. While the 
older, more traditional definitions of discretionary access control require identity-based access 
control, that limitation is not required for this use of discretionary access control. 
(5) ACCESS ENFORCEMENT | SECURITY-RELEVANT INFORMATION  
The information system prevents access to [Assignment: organization-defined security-relevant 
information] except during secure, non-operable system states. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Security-relevant information is any information within information 
systems that can potentially impact the operation of security functions or the provision of 
security services in a manner that could result in failure to enforce system security policies or 
maintain the isolation of code and data. Security-relevant information includes, for example, 
filtering rules for routers/firewalls, cryptographic key management information, configuration 
parameters for security services, and access control lists. Secure, non-operable system states 
include the times in which information systems are not performing mission/business-related 
processing (e.g., the system is off-line for maintenance, troubleshooting, boot-up, shut down). 
Related control: CM-3. 
(6) ACCESS ENFORCEMENT | PROTECTION OF USER AND SYSTEM INFORMATION  
[Withdrawn: Incorporated into MP-4 and SC-28]. 
(7) ACCESS ENFORCEMENT | ROLE-BASED ACCESS CONTROL 
The information system enforces a role-based access control policy over defined subjects and 
objects and controls access based upon [Assignment: organization-defined roles and users 
authorized to assume such roles]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Role-based access control (RBAC) is an access control policy that 
restricts information system access to authorized users. Organizations can create specific roles 
based on job functions and the authorizations (i.e., privileges) to perform needed operations 
on organizational information systems associated with the organization-defined roles. When 
users are assigned to the organizational roles, they inherit the authorizations or privileges 
defined for those roles. RBAC simplifies privilege administration for organizations because

________________________________________________________________________________________________ 
APPENDIX F-AC   PAGE F-13 
privileges are not assigned directly to every user (which can be a significant number of 
individuals for mid- to large-size organizations) but are instead acquired through role 
assignments. RBAC can be implemented either as a mandatory or discretionary form of 
access control. For organizations implementing RBAC with mandatory access controls, the 
requirements in AC-3 (3) define the scope of the subjects and objects covered by the policy. 
(8) ACCESS ENFORCEMENT | REVOCATION OF ACCESS AUTHORIZATIONS  
The information system enforces the revocation of access authorizations resulting from changes 
to the security attributes of subjects and objects based on [Assignment: organization-defined rules 
governing the timing of revocations of access authorizations]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Revocation of access rules may differ based on the types of access 
revoked. For example, if a subject (i.e., user or process) is removed from a group, access may 
not be revoked until the next time the object (e.g., file) is opened or until the next time the 
subject attempts a new access to the object. Revocation based on changes to security labels 
may take effect immediately. Organizations can provide alternative approaches on how to 
make revocations immediate if information systems cannot provide such capability and 
immediate revocation is necessary. 
(9) ACCESS ENFORCEMENT | CONTROLLED RELEASE  
The information system does not release information outside of the established system boundary 
unless: 
(a) The receiving [Assignment: organization-defined information system or system component] 
provides [Assignment: organization-defined security safeguards]; and 
(b) [Assignment: organization-defined security safeguards] are used to validate the 
appropriateness of the information designated for release. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Information systems can only protect organizational information 
within the confines of established system boundaries. Additional security safeguards may be 
needed to ensure that such information is adequately protected once it is passed beyond the 
established information system boundaries. Examples of information leaving the system 
boundary include transmitting information to an external information system or printing the 
information on one of its printers. In cases where the information system is unable to make a 
determination of the adequacy of the protections provided by entities outside its boundary, as 
a mitigating control, organizations determine procedurally whether the external information 
systems are providing adequate security. The means used to determine the adequacy of the 
security provided by external information systems include, for example, conducting 
inspections or periodic testing, establishing agreements between the organization and its 
counterpart organizations, or some other process. The means used by external entities to 
protect the information received need not be the same as those used by the organization, but 
the means employed are sufficient to provide consistent adjudication of the security policy to 
protect the information. This control enhancement requires information systems to employ 
technical or procedural means to validate the information prior to releasing it to external 
systems. For example, if the information system passes information to another system 
controlled by another organization, technical means are employed to validate that the security 
attributes associated with the exported information are appropriate for the receiving system. 
Alternatively, if the information system passes information to a printer in organization-
controlled space, procedural means can be employed to ensure that only appropriately 
authorized individuals gain access to the printer. This control enhancement is most applicable 
when there is some policy mandate (e.g., law, Executive Order, directive, or regulation) that 
establishes policy regarding access to the information, and that policy applies beyond the 
realm of a particular information system or organization. 
(10) ACCESS ENFORCEMENT | AUDITED OVERRIDE OF ACCESS CONTROL MECHANISMS  
The organization employs an audited override of automated access control mechanisms under 
[Assignment: organization-defined conditions].

AC-4 INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT 
Control:  The information system enforces approved authorizations for controlling the flow of 
information within the system and between interconnected systems based on [Assignment: 
organization-defined information flow control policies]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Information flow control regulates where information is allowed to travel 
within an information system and between information systems (as opposed to who is allowed to 
access the information) and without explicit regard to subsequent accesses to that information. 
Flow control restrictions include, for example, keeping export-controlled information from being 
transmitted in the clear to the Internet, blocking outside traffic that claims to be from within the 
organization, restricting web requests to the Internet that are not from the internal web proxy 
server, and limiting information transfers between organizations based on data structures and 
content. Transferring information between information systems representing different security 
domains with different security policies introduces risk that such transfers violate one or more 
domain security policies. In such situations, information owners/stewards provide guidance at 
designated policy enforcement points between interconnected systems. Organizations consider 
mandating specific architectural solutions when required to enforce specific security policies. 
Enforcement includes, for example: (i) prohibiting information transfers between interconnected 
systems (i.e., allowing access only); (ii) employing hardware mechanisms to enforce one-way 
information flows; and (iii) implementing trustworthy regrading mechanisms to reassign security 
attributes and security labels. 
Organizations commonly employ information flow control policies and enforcement mechanisms 
to control the flow of information between designated sources and destinations (e.g., networks, 
individuals, and devices) within information systems and between interconnected systems. Flow 
control is based on the characteristics of the information and/or the information path. Enforcement 
occurs, for example, in boundary protection devices (e.g., gateways, routers, guards, encrypted 
tunnels, firewalls) that employ rule sets or establish configuration settings that restrict information 
system services, provide a packet-filtering capability based on header information, or message-
filtering capability based on message content (e.g., implementing key word searches or using 
document characteristics). Organizations also consider the trustworthiness of filtering/inspection 
mechanisms (i.e., hardware, firmware, and software components) that are critical to information 
flow enforcement. Control enhancements 3 through 22 primarily address cross-domain solution 
needs which focus on more advanced filtering techniques, in-depth analysis, and stronger flow 
enforcement mechanisms implemented in cross-domain products, for example, high-assurance 
guards. Such capabilities are generally not available in commercial off-the-shelf information 
technology products. Related controls: AC-3, AC-17, AC-19, AC-21, CM-6, CM-7, SA-8, SC-2, 
SC-5, SC-7, SC-18. 
Control Enhancements: 
(1) INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT | OBJECT SECURITY ATTRIBUTES  
The information system uses [Assignment: organization-defined security attributes] associated 
with [Assignment: organization-defined information, source, and destination objects] to enforce 
[Assignment: organization-defined information flow control policies] as a basis for flow control 
decisions. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Information flow enforcement mechanisms compare security attributes 
associated with information (data content and data structure) and source/destination objects, 
and respond appropriately (e.g., block, quarantine, alert administrator) when the mechanisms 
encounter information flows not explicitly allowed by information flow policies. For example, 
an information object labeled Secret would be allowed to flow to a destination object labeled 
Secret, but an information object labeled Top Secret would not be allowed to flow to a

________________________________________________________________________________________________ 
APPENDIX F-AC   PAGE F-15 
destination object labeled Secret. Security attributes can also include, for example, source and 
destination addresses employed in traffic filter firewalls. Flow enforcement using explicit 
security attributes can be used, for example, to control the release of certain types of 
information. Related control: AC-16. 
(2) INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT | PROCESSING DOMAINS  
The information system uses protected processing domains to enforce [Assignment: organization-
defined information flow control policies] as a basis for flow control decisions. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Within information systems, protected processing domains are 
processing spaces that have controlled interactions with other processing spaces, thus 
enabling control of information flows between these spaces and to/from data/information 
objects. A protected processing domain can be provided, for example, by implementing 
domain and type enforcement. In domain and type enforcement, information system processes 
are assigned to domains; information is identified by types; and information flows are 
controlled based on allowed information accesses (determined by domain and type), allowed 
signaling among domains, and allowed process transitions to other domains. 
(3) INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT | DYNAMIC INFORMATION FLOW CONTROL  
The information system enforces dynamic information flow control based on [Assignment: 
organization-defined policies]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Organizational policies regarding dynamic information flow control 
include, for example, allowing or disallowing information flows based on changing conditions 
or mission/operational considerations. Changing conditions include, for example, changes in 
organizational risk tolerance due to changes in the immediacy of mission/business needs, 
changes in the threat environment, and detection of potentially harmful or adverse events. 
Related control: SI-4. 
(4) INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT  | CONTENT CHECK ENCRYPTED INFORMATION  
The information system prevents encrypted information from bypassing content-checking 
mechanisms by [Selection (one or more): decrypting the information; blocking the flow of the 
encrypted information; terminating communications sessions attempting to pass encrypted 
information; [Assignment: organization-defined procedure or method]]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Related control: SI-4. 
(5) INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT | EMBEDDED DATA TYPES  
The information system enforces [Assignment: organization-defined limitations] on embedding 
data types within other data types. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Embedding data types within other data types may result in reduced 
flow control effectiveness. Data type embedding includes, for example, inserting executable 
files as objects within word processing files, inserting references or descriptive information 
into a media file, and compressed or archived data types that may include multiple embedded 
data types. Limitations on data type embedding consider the levels of embedding and prohibit 
levels of data type embedding that are beyond the capability of the inspection tools. 
(6) INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT | METADATA 
The information system enforces information flow control based on [Assignment: organization-
defined metadata]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Metadata is information used to describe the characteristics of data. 
Metadata can include structural metadata describing data structures (e.g., data format, syntax, 
and semantics) or descriptive metadata describing data contents (e.g., age, location, telephone 
number). Enforcing allowed information flows based on metadata enables simpler and more 
effective flow control. Organizations consider the trustworthiness of metadata with regard to 
data accuracy (i.e., knowledge that the metadata values are correct with respect to the data), 
data integrity (i.e., protecting against unauthorized changes to metadata tags), and the binding 
of metadata to the data payload (i.e., ensuring sufficiently strong binding techniques with 
appropriate levels of assurance). Related controls: AC-16, SI-7. 
(7) INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT | ONE-WAY FLOW MECHANISMS  
The information system enforces [Assignment: organization-defined one-way flows] using 
hardware mechanisms.

________________________________________________________________________________________________ 
APPENDIX F-AC   PAGE F-16 
(8) INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT | SECURITY POLICY FILTERS 
The information system enforces information flow control using [Assignment: organization-defined 
security policy filters] as a basis for flow control decisions for [Assignment: organization-defined 
information flows]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Organization-defined security policy filters can address data structures 
and content. For example, security policy filters for data structures can check for maximum 
file lengths, maximum field sizes, and data/file types (for structured and unstructured data). 
Security policy filters for data content can check for specific words (e.g., dirty/clean word 
filters), enumerated values or data value ranges, and hidden content. Structured data permits 
the interpretation of data content by applications. Unstructured data typically refers to digital 
information without a particular data structure or with a data structure that does not facilitate 
the development of rule sets to address the particular sensitivity of the information conveyed 
by the data or the associated flow enforcement decisions. Unstructured data consists of: (i) 
bitmap objects that are inherently non language-based (i.e., image, video, or audio files); and 
(ii) textual objects that are based on written or printed languages (e.g., commercial off-the-
shelf word processing documents, spreadsheets, or emails). Organizations can implement 
more than one security policy filter to meet information flow control objectives (e.g., 
employing clean word lists in conjunction with dirty word lists may help to reduce false 
positives). 
(9) INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT | HUMAN REVIEWS  
The information system enforces the use of human reviews for [Assignment: organization-defined 
information flows] under the following conditions: [Assignment: organization-defined conditions]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Organizations define security policy filters for all situations where 
automated flow control decisions are possible. When a fully automated flow control decision 
is not possible, then a human review may be employed in lieu of, or as a complement to, 
automated security policy filtering. Human reviews may also be employed as deemed 
necessary by organizations. 
(10) INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT | ENABLE / DISABLE SECURITY POLICY FILTERS  
The information system provides the capability for privileged administrators to enable/disable 
[Assignment: organization-defined security policy filters] under the following conditions: 
[Assignment: organization-defined conditions]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  For example, as allowed by the information system authorization, 
administrators can enable security policy filters to accommodate approved data types. 
(11) INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT | CONFIGURATION OF SECURITY POLICY FILTERS  
The information system provides the capability for privileged administrators to configure 
[Assignment: organization-defined security policy filters] to support different security policies. 
Supplemental Guidance:  For example, to reflect changes in security policies, administrators can 
change the list of “dirty words” that security policy mechanisms check in accordance with the 
definitions provided by organizations. 
(12) INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT | DATA TYPE IDENTIFIERS  
The information system, when transferring information between different security domains, uses 
[Assignment: organization-defined data type identifiers] to validate data essential for information 
flow decisions. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Data type identifiers include, for example, filenames, file types, file 
signatures/tokens, and multiple internal file signatures/tokens. Information systems may allow 
transfer of data only if compliant with data type format specifications. 
(13) INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT | DECOMPOSITION INTO POLICY-RELEVANT SUBCOMPONENTS  
The information system, when transferring information between different security domains, 
decomposes information into [Assignment: organization-defined policy-relevant subcomponents] 
for submission to policy enforcement mechanisms. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Policy enforcement mechanisms apply filtering, inspection, and/or 
sanitization rules to the policy-relevant subcomponents of information to facilitate flow 
enforcement prior to transferring such information to different security domains. Parsing 
transfer files facilitates policy decisions on source, destination, certificates, classification, 
attachments, and other security-related component differentiators.

APPENDIX F-AC   PAGE F-17 
(14) INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT | SECURITY POLICY FILTER CONSTRAINTS  
The information system, when transferring information between different security domains, 
implements [Assignment: organization-defined security policy filters] requiring fully enumerated 
formats that restrict data structure and content. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Data structure and content restrictions reduce the range of potential 
malicious and/or unsanctioned content in cross-domain transactions. Security policy filters 
that restrict data structures include, for example, restricting file sizes and field lengths. Data 
content policy filters include, for example: (i) encoding formats for character sets (e.g., 
Universal Character Set Transformation Formats, American Standard Code for Information 
Interchange); (ii) restricting character data fields to only contain alpha-numeric characters; 
(iii) prohibiting special characters; and (iv) validating schema structures. 
(15) INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT | DETECTION OF UNSANCTIONED INFORMATION 
The information system, when transferring information between different security domains, 
examines the information for the presence of [Assignment: organized-defined unsanctioned 
information] and prohibits the transfer of such information in accordance with the [Assignment: 
organization-defined security policy]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Detection of unsanctioned information includes, for example, checking 
all information to be transferred for malicious code and dirty words. Related control: SI-3. 
(16) INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT | INFORMATION TRANSFERS ON INTERCONNECTED SYSTEMS  
[Withdrawn: Incorporated into AC-4]. 
(17) INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT | DOMAIN AUTHENTICATION  
The information system uniquely identifies and authenticates source and destination points by 
[Selection (one or more): organization, system, application, individual] for information transfer. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Attribution is a critical component of a security concept of operations. 
The ability to identify source and destination points for information flowing in information 
systems, allows the forensic reconstruction of events when required, and encourages policy 
compliance by attributing policy violations to specific organizations/individuals. Successful 
domain authentication requires that information system labels distinguish among systems, 
organizations, and individuals involved in preparing, sending, receiving, or disseminating 
information. Related controls: IA-2, IA-3, IA-4, IA-5. 
(18) INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT | SECURITY ATTRIBUTE BINDING  
The information system binds security attributes to information using [Assignment: organization-
defined binding techniques] to facilitate information flow policy enforcement. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Binding techniques implemented by information systems affect the 
strength of security attribute binding to information. Binding strength and the assurance 
associated with binding techniques play an important part in the trust organizations have in 
the information flow enforcement process. The binding techniques affect the number and 
degree of additional reviews required by organizations. Related controls: AC-16, SC-16. 
(19) INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT | VALIDATION OF METADATA  
The information system, when transferring information between different security domains, applies 
the same security policy filtering to metadata as it applies to data payloads. 
Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement requires the validation of metadata and the 
data to which the metadata applies. Some organizations distinguish between metadata and 
data payloads (i.e., only the data to which the metadata is bound). Other organizations do not 
make such distinctions, considering metadata and the data to which the metadata applies as 
part of the payload. All information (including metadata and the data to which the metadata 
applies) is subject to filtering and inspection. 
(20) INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT | APPROVED SOLUTIONS  
The organization employs [Assignment: organization-defined solutions in approved 
configurations] to control the flow of [Assignment: organization-defined information] across 
security domains. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Organizations define approved solutions and configurations in cross-
domain policies and guidance in accordance with the types of information flows across

provides a baseline listing of approved cross-domain solutions. 
(21) INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT | PHYSICAL / LOGICAL SEPARATION OF INFORMATION FLOWS   
The information system separates information flows logically or physically using [Assignment: 
organization-defined mechanisms and/or techniques] to accomplish [Assignment: organization-
defined required separations by types of information]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Enforcing the separation of information flows by type can enhance 
protection by ensuring that information is not commingled while in transit and by enabling 
flow control by transmission paths perhaps not otherwise achievable. Types of separable 
information include, for example, inbound and outbound communications traffic, service 
requests and responses, and information of differing security categories. 
(22) INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT | ACCESS ONLY   
The information system provides access from a single device to computing platforms, 
applications, or data residing on multiple different security domains, while preventing any 
information flow between the different security domains. 
Supplemental Guidance:  The information system, for example, provides a desktop for users to 
access each connected security domain without providing any mechanisms to allow transfer 
of information between the different security domains.

b. Documents separation of duties of individuals; and  
c. Defines information system access authorizations to support separation of duties. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Separation of duties addresses the potential for abuse of authorized 
privileges and helps to reduce the risk of malevolent activity without collusion. Separation of 
duties includes, for example: (i) dividing mission functions and information system support 
functions among different individuals and/or roles; (ii) conducting information system support 
functions with different individuals (e.g., system management, programming, configuration 
management, quality assurance and testing, and network security); and (iii) ensuring security 
personnel administering access control functions do not also administer audit functions. Related

________________________________________________________________________________________________ 
APPENDIX F-AC   PAGE F-19 
Supplemental Guidance:  Organizations employ least privilege for specific duties and information 
systems. The principle of least privilege is also applied to information system processes, ensuring 
that the processes operate at privilege levels no higher than necessary to accomplish required 
organizational missions/business functions. Organizations consider the creation of additional 
processes, roles, and information system accounts as necessary, to achieve least privilege. 
Organizations also apply least privilege to the development, implementation, and operation of 
organizational information systems. Related controls: AC-2, AC-3, AC-5, CM-6, CM-7, PL-2.   
Control Enhancements:  
(1) LEAST PRIVILEGE | AUTHORIZE ACCESS TO SECURITY FUNCTIONS  
The organization explicitly authorizes access to [Assignment: organization-defined security 
functions (deployed in hardware, software, and firmware) and security-relevant information]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Security functions include, for example, establishing system accounts, 
configuring access authorizations (i.e., permissions, privileges), setting events to be audited, 
and setting intrusion detection parameters. Security-relevant information includes, for 
example, filtering rules for routers/firewalls, cryptographic key management information, 
configuration parameters for security services, and access control lists. Explicitly authorized 
personnel include, for example, security administrators, system and network administrators, 
system security officers, system maintenance personnel, system programmers, and other 
privileged users. Related controls: AC-17, AC-18, AC-19. 
(2) LEAST PRIVILEGE | NON-PRIVILEGED ACCESS FOR NONSECURITY FUNCTIONS  
The organization requires that users of information system accounts, or roles, with access to 
[Assignment: organization-defined security functions or security-relevant information], use non-
privileged accounts or roles, when accessing nonsecurity functions. 
Supplemental Guidance:  This control enhancement limits exposure when operating from within 
privileged accounts or roles. The inclusion of roles addresses situations where organizations 
implement access control policies such as role-based access control and where a change of 
role provides the same degree of assurance in the change of access authorizations for both the 
user and all processes acting on behalf of the user as would be provided by a change between 
a privileged and non-privileged account. Related control: PL-4. 
(3) LEAST PRIVILEGE | NETWORK ACCESS TO PRIVILEGED COMMANDS  
The organization authorizes network access to [Assignment: organization-defined privileged 
commands] only for [Assignment: organization-defined compelling operational needs] and 
documents the rationale for such access in the security plan for the information system. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Network access is any access across a network connection in lieu of 
local access (i.e., user being physically present at the device). Related control: AC-17. 
(4) LEAST PRIVILEGE | SEPARATE PROCESSING DOMAINS  
The information system provides separate processing domains to enable finer-grained allocation 
of user privileges. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Providing separate processing domains for finer-grained allocation of 
user privileges includes, for example: (i) using virtualization techniques to allow additional 
privileges within a virtual machine while restricting privileges to other virtual machines or to 
the underlying actual machine; (ii) employing hardware and/or software domain separation 
mechanisms; and (iii) implementing separate physical domains. Related controls: AC-4, SC-3, 
SC-30, SC-32. 
(5) LEAST PRIVILEGE | PRIVILEGED ACCOUNTS  
The organization restricts privileged accounts on the information system to [Assignment: 
organization-defined personnel or roles]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Privileged accounts, including super user accounts, are typically 
described as system administrator for various types of commercial off-the-shelf operating 
systems. Restricting privileged accounts to specific personnel or roles prevents day-to-day 
users from having access to privileged information/functions. Organizations may differentiate 
in the application of this control enhancement between allowed privileges for local accounts 
and for domain accounts provided organizations retain the ability to control information

mitigate risk. Related control: CM-6. 
(6) LEAST PRIVILEGE | PRIVILEGED ACCESS BY NON-ORGANIZATIONAL USERS  
The organization prohibits privileged access to the information system by non-organizational 
users. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Related control: IA-8. 
(7) LEAST PRIVILEGE | REVIEW OF USER PRIVILEGES 
The organization:  
(a) Reviews [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] the privileges assigned to 
[Assignment: organization-defined roles or classes of users] to validate the need for such 
privileges; and 
(b) Reassigns or removes privileges, if necessary, to correctly reflect organizational 
mission/business needs. 
Supplemental Guidance:  The need for certain assigned user privileges may change over time 
reflecting changes in organizational missions/business function, environments of operation, 
technologies, or threat. Periodic review of assigned user privileges is necessary to determine if 
the rationale for assigning such privileges remains valid. If the need cannot be revalidated, 
organizations take appropriate corrective actions. Related control: CA-7. 
(8) LEAST PRIVILEGE | PRIVILEGE LEVELS FOR CODE EXECUTION  
The information system prevents [Assignment: organization-defined software] from executing at 
higher privilege levels than users executing the software. 
Supplemental Guidance:  In certain situations, software applications/programs need to execute 
with elevated privileges to perform required functions. However, if the privileges required for 
execution are at a higher level than the privileges assigned to organizational users invoking 
such applications/programs, those users are indirectly provided with greater privileges than 
assigned by organizations. 
(9) LEAST PRIVILEGE | AUDITING USE OF PRIVILEGED FUNCTIONS  
The information system audits the execution of privileged functions. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Misuse of privileged functions, either intentionally or unintentionally 
by authorized users, or by unauthorized external entities that have compromised information 
system accounts, is a serious and ongoing concern and can have significant adverse impacts 
on organizations. Auditing the use of privileged functions is one way to detect such misuse, 
and in doing so, help mitigate the risk from insider threats and the advanced persistent threat 
(APT). Related control: AU-2. 
(10) LEAST PRIVILEGE | PROHIBIT NON-PRIVILEGED USERS FROM EXECUTING PRIVILEGED FUNCTIONS  
The information system prevents non-privileged users from executing privileged functions to 
include disabling, circumventing, or altering implemented security safeguards/countermeasures. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Privileged functions include, for example, establishing information 
system accounts, performing system integrity checks, or administering cryptographic key 
management activities. Non-privileged users are individuals that do not possess appropriate 
authorizations. Circumventing intrusion detection and prevention mechanisms or malicious 
code protection mechanisms are examples of privileged functions that require protection from 
non-privileged users.

AC-7 UNSUCCESSFUL LOGON ATTEMPTS 
 Control:  The information system: 
a. Enforces a limit of [Assignment: organization-defined number] consecutive invalid logon 
attempts by a user during a [Assignment: organization-defined time period]; and 
b. Automatically [Selection: locks the account/node for an [Assignment: organization-defined 
time period]; locks the account/node until released by an administrator; delays next logon 
prompt according to [Assignment: organization-defined delay algorithm]] when the 
maximum number of unsuccessful attempts is exceeded. 
Supplemental Guidance:  This control applies regardless of whether the logon occurs via a local or 
network connection. Due to the potential for denial of service, automatic lockouts initiated by 
information systems are usually temporary and automatically release after a predetermined time 
period established by organizations. If a delay algorithm is selected, organizations may choose to 
employ different algorithms for different information system components based on the capabilities 
of those components. Responses to unsuccessful logon attempts may be implemented at both the 
operating system and the application levels. Related controls: AC-2, AC-9, AC-14, IA-5. 
Control Enhancements: 
(1) UNSUCCESSFUL LOGON ATTEMPTS | AUTOMATIC ACCOUNT LOCK 
[Withdrawn: Incorporated into AC-7]. 
(2) UNSUCCESSFUL LOGON ATTEMPTS | PURGE / WIPE MOBILE DEVICE  
The information system purges/wipes information from [Assignment: organization-defined mobile 
devices] based on [Assignment: organization-defined purging/wiping requirements/techniques] 
after [Assignment: organization-defined number] consecutive, unsuccessful device logon 
attempts. 
Supplemental Guidance:  This control enhancement applies only to mobile devices for which a 
logon occurs (e.g., personal digital assistants, smart phones, tablets). The logon is to the 
mobile device, not to any one account on the device. Therefore, successful logons to any 
accounts on mobile devices reset the unsuccessful logon count to zero. Organizations define 
information to be purged/wiped carefully in order to avoid over purging/wiping which may 
result in devices becoming unusable. Purging/wiping may be unnecessary if the information 
on the device is protected with sufficiently strong encryption mechanisms. Related controls:

1. Displays system use information [Assignment: organization-defined conditions], before 
granting further access; 
2. Displays references, if any, to monitoring, recording, or auditing that are consistent with 
privacy accommodations for such systems that generally prohibit those activities; and 
3. Includes a description of the authorized uses of the system. 
Supplemental Guidance:  System use notifications can be implemented using messages or warning 
banners displayed before individuals log in to information systems. System use notifications are 
used only for access via logon interfaces with human users and are not required when such human 
interfaces do not exist. Organizations consider system use notification messages/banners displayed 
in multiple languages based on specific organizational needs and the demographics of information 
system users. Organizations also consult with the Office of the General Counsel for legal review 
and approval of warning banner content.

Supplemental Guidance:  This control is applicable to logons to information systems via human user 
interfaces and logons to systems that occur in other types of architectures (e.g., service-oriented 
architectures). Related controls: AC-7, PL-4. 
Control Enhancements: 
(1) PREVIOUS LOGON NOTIFICATION | UNSUCCESSFUL LOGONS 
The information system notifies the user, upon successful logon/access, of the number of 
unsuccessful logon/access attempts since the last successful logon/access. 
(2) PREVIOUS LOGON NOTIFICATION | SUCCESSFUL / UNSUCCESSFUL LOGONS 
The information system notifies the user of the number of [Selection: successful logons/accesses; 
unsuccessful logon/access attempts; both] during [Assignment: organization-defined time period]. 
(3) PREVIOUS LOGON NOTIFICATION | NOTIFICATION OF ACCOUNT CHANGES

The information system notifies the user, upon successful logon (access), of the following 
additional information: [Assignment: organization-defined information to be included in addition to 
the date and time of the last logon (access)]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  This control enhancement permits organizations to specify additional 
information to be provided to users upon logon including, for example, the location of last 
logon. User location is defined as that information which can be determined by information 
systems, for example, IP addresses from which network logons occurred, device identifiers, or 
notifications of local logons.

information system accounts globally, by account type (e.g., privileged user, non-privileged user, 
domain, specific application), by account, or a combination. For example, organizations may limit 
the number of concurrent sessions for system administrators or individuals working in particularly

b. Retains the session lock until the user reestablishes access using established identification and 
authentication procedures. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Session locks are temporary actions taken when users stop work and move 
away from the immediate vicinity of information systems but do not want to log out because of the 
temporary nature of their absences. Session locks are implemented where session activities can be 
determined. This is typically at the operating system level, but can also be at the application level. 
Session locks are not an acceptable substitute for logging out of information systems, for example, 
if organizations require users to log out at the end of workdays. Related control: AC-7.

example, patterns used with screen savers, photographic images, solid colors, clock, battery 
life indicator, or a blank screen, with the additional caveat that none of the images convey 
sensitive information.

AC-12 SESSION TERMINATION 
Control:  The information system automatically terminates a user session after [Assignment: 
organization-defined conditions or trigger events requiring session disconnect].  
Supplemental Guidance:  This control addresses the termination of user-initiated logical sessions in 
contrast to SC-10 which addresses the termination of network connections that are associated with 
communications sessions (i.e., network disconnect). A logical session (for local, network, and 
remote access) is initiated whenever a user (or process acting on behalf of a user) accesses an 
organizational information system. Such user sessions can be terminated (and thus terminate user 
access) without terminating network sessions. Session termination terminates all processes 
associated with a user’s logical session except those processes that are specifically created by the 
user (i.e., session owner) to continue after the session is terminated. Conditions or trigger events 
requiring automatic session termination can include, for example, organization-defined periods of 
user inactivity, targeted responses to certain types of incidents, time-of-day restrictions on 
information system use. Related controls: SC-10, SC-23. 
Control Enhancements: 
(1) SESSION TERMINATION | USER-INITIATED LOGOUTS / MESSAGE DISPLAYS

(b) Displays an explicit logout message to users indicating the reliable termination of 
authenticated communications sessions. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Information resources to which users gain access via authentication 
include, for example, local workstations, databases, and password-protected websites/web-
based services. Logout messages for web page access, for example, can be displayed after 
authenticated sessions have been terminated. However, for some types of interactive sessions 
including, for example, file transfer protocol (FTP) sessions, information systems typically 
send logout messages as final messages prior to terminating sessions.

b. Documents and provides supporting rationale in the security plan for the information system, 
user actions not requiring identification or authentication. 
Supplemental Guidance:  This control addresses situations in which organizations determine that no 
identification or authentication is required in organizational information systems. Organizations 
may allow a limited number of user actions without identification or authentication including, for 
example, when individuals access public websites or other publicly accessible federal information 
systems, when individuals use mobile phones to receive calls, or when facsimiles are received. 
Organizations also identify actions that normally require identification or authentication but may 
under certain circumstances (e.g., emergencies), allow identification or authentication mechanisms 
to be bypassed. Such bypasses may occur, for example, via a software-readable physical switch 
that commands bypass of the logon functionality and is protected from accidental or unmonitored 
use. This control does not apply to situations where identification and authentication have already 
occurred and are not repeated, but rather to situations where identification and authentication have 
not yet occurred. Organizations may decide that there are no user actions that can be performed on 
organizational information systems without identification and authentication and thus, the values 
for assignment statements can be none. Related controls: CP-2, IA-2.

information in storage, in process, and/or in transmission; 
b. Ensures that the security attribute associations are made and retained with the information; 
c. Establishes the permitted [Assignment: organization-defined security attributes] for 
[Assignment: organization-defined information systems]; and 
d. Determines the permitted [Assignment: organization-defined values or ranges] for each of the 
established security attributes. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Information is represented internally within information systems using 
abstractions known as data structures. Internal data structures can represent different types of 
entities, both active and passive. Active entities, also known as subjects, are typically associated 
with individuals, devices, or processes acting on behalf of individuals. Passive entities, also known 
as objects, are typically associated with data structures such as records, buffers, tables, files, inter-
process pipes, and communications ports. Security attributes, a form of metadata, are abstractions 
representing the basic properties or characteristics of active and passive entities with respect to 
safeguarding information. These attributes may be associated with active entities (i.e., subjects)

or to change the information system state. These attributes may also be associated with passive 
entities (i.e., objects) that contain or receive information. The association of security attributes to 
subjects and objects is referred to as binding and is typically inclusive of setting the attribute value 
and the attribute type. Security attributes when bound to data/information, enables the enforcement 
of information security policies for access control and information flow control, either through 
organizational processes or information system functions or mechanisms. The content or assigned 
values of security attributes can directly affect the ability of individuals to access organizational 
information. 
Organizations can define the types of attributes needed for selected information systems to support 
missions/business functions. There is potentially a wide range of values that can be assigned to 
any given security attribute. Release markings could include, for example, US only, NATO, or 
NOFORN (not releasable to foreign nationals). By specifying permitted attribute ranges and 
values, organizations can ensure that the security attribute values are meaningful and relevant. The 
term security labeling refers to the association of security attributes with subjects and objects 
represented by internal data structures within organizational information systems, to enable 
information system-based enforcement of information security policies. Security labels include, 
for example, access authorizations, data life cycle protection (i.e., encryption and data expiration), 
nationality, affiliation as contractor, and classification of information in accordance with legal and 
compliance requirements. The term security marking refers to the association of security attributes 
with objects in a human-readable form, to enable organizational process-based enforcement of 
information security policies. The AC-16 base control represents the requirement for user-based 
attribute association (marking). The enhancements to AC-16 represent additional requirements 
including information system-based attribute association (labeling). Types of attributes include, 
for example, classification level for objects and clearance (access authorization) level for subjects. 
An example of a value for both of these attribute types is Top Secret. Related controls: AC-3, AC-
4, AC-6, AC-21, AU-2, AU-10, SC-16, MP-3. 
Control Enhancements:  
(1) SECURITY ATTRIBUTES | DYNAMIC ATTRIBUTE ASSOCIATION 
The information system dynamically associates security attributes with [Assignment: organization-
defined subjects and objects] in accordance with [Assignment: organization-defined security 
policies] as information is created and combined. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Dynamic association of security attributes is appropriate whenever the 
security characteristics of information changes over time. Security attributes may change, for 
example, due to information aggregation issues (i.e., the security characteristics of individual 
information elements are different from the combined elements), changes in individual access 
authorizations (i.e., privileges), and changes in the security category of information. Related 
control: AC-4. 
(2) SECURITY ATTRIBUTES | ATTRIBUTE VALUE CHANGES BY AUTHORIZED INDIVIDUALS  
The information system provides authorized individuals (or processes acting on behalf of 
individuals) the capability to define or change the value of associated security attributes. 
Supplemental Guidance:  The content or assigned values of security attributes can directly affect 
the ability of individuals to access organizational information. Therefore, it is important for 
information systems to be able to limit the ability to create or modify security attributes to 
authorized individuals. Related controls: AC-6, AU-2. 
(3) SECURITY ATTRIBUTES | MAINTENANCE OF ATTRIBUTE ASSOCIATIONS BY INFORMATION SYSTEM  
The information system maintains the association and integrity of [Assignment: organization-
defined security attributes] to [Assignment: organization-defined subjects and objects]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Maintaining the association and integrity of security attributes to 
subjects and objects with sufficient assurance helps to ensure that the attribute associations 
can be used as the basis of automated policy actions. Automated policy actions include, for 
example, access control decisions or information flow control decisions.

________________________________________________________________________________________________ 
APPENDIX F-AC   PAGE F-27 
(4) SECURITY ATTRIBUTES | ASSOCIATION OF ATTRIBUTES BY AUTHORIZED INDIVIDUALS  
The information system supports the association of [Assignment: organization-defined security 
attributes] with [Assignment: organization-defined subjects and objects] by authorized individuals 
(or processes acting on behalf of individuals). 
Supplemental Guidance:  The support provided by information systems can vary to include: (i) 
prompting users to select specific security attributes to be associated with specific information 
objects; (ii) employing automated mechanisms for categorizing information with appropriate 
attributes based on defined policies; or (iii) ensuring that the combination of selected security 
attributes selected is valid. Organizations consider the creation, deletion, or modification of 
security attributes when defining auditable events. 
(5) SECURITY ATTRIBUTES | ATTRIBUTE DISPLAYS FOR OUTPUT DEVICES  
The information system displays security attributes in human-readable form on each object that 
the system transmits to output devices to identify [Assignment: organization-identified special 
dissemination, handling, or distribution instructions] using [Assignment: organization-identified 
human-readable, standard naming conventions]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Information system outputs include, for example, pages, screens, or 
equivalent. Information system output devices include, for example, printers and video 
displays on computer workstations, notebook computers, and personal digital assistants. 
(6) SECURITY ATTRIBUTES | MAINTENANCE OF ATTRIBUTE ASSOCIATION BY ORGANIZATION 
The organization allows personnel to associate, and maintain the association of [Assignment: 
organization-defined security attributes] with [Assignment: organization-defined subjects and 
objects] in accordance with [Assignment: organization-defined security policies]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  This control enhancement requires individual users (as opposed to the 
information system) to maintain associations of security attributes with subjects and objects. 
(7) SECURITY ATTRIBUTES | CONSISTENT ATTRIBUTE INTERPRETATION 
The organization provides a consistent interpretation of security attributes transmitted between 
distributed information system components. 
Supplemental Guidance:  In order to enforce security policies across multiple components in 
distributed information systems (e.g., distributed database management systems, cloud-based 
systems, and service-oriented architectures), organizations provide a consistent interpretation 
of security attributes that are used in access enforcement and flow enforcement decisions. 
Organizations establish agreements and processes to ensure that all distributed information 
system components implement security attributes with consistent interpretations in automated 
access/flow enforcement actions. 
(8) SECURITY ATTRIBUTES | ASSOCIATION TECHNIQUES / TECHNOLOGIES  
The information system implements [Assignment: organization-defined techniques or 
technologies] with [Assignment: organization-defined level of assurance] in associating security 
attributes to information. 
Supplemental Guidance:  The association (i.e., binding) of security attributes to information 
within information systems is of significant importance with regard to conducting automated 
access enforcement and flow enforcement actions. The association of such security attributes 
can be accomplished with technologies/techniques providing different levels of assurance. For 
example, information systems can cryptographically bind security attributes to information 
using digital signatures with the supporting cryptographic keys protected by hardware devices 
(sometimes known as hardware roots of trust). 
(9) SECURITY ATTRIBUTES | ATTRIBUTE REASSIGNMENT  
The organization ensures that security attributes associated with information are reassigned only 
via re-grading mechanisms validated using [Assignment: organization-defined techniques or 
procedures]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Validated re-grading mechanisms are employed by organizations to 
provide the requisite levels of assurance for security attribute reassignment activities. The 
validation is facilitated by ensuring that re-grading mechanisms are single purpose and of 
limited function. Since security attribute reassignments can affect security policy enforcement 
actions (e.g., access/flow enforcement decisions), using trustworthy re-grading mechanisms is 
necessary to ensure that such mechanisms perform in a consistent/correct mode of operation.

(10) SECURITY ATTRIBUTES | ATTRIBUTE CONFIGURATION BY AUTHORIZED INDIVIDUALS  
The information system provides authorized individuals the capability to define or change the type 
and value of security attributes available for association with subjects and objects. 
Supplemental Guidance:  The content or assigned values of security attributes can directly affect 
the ability of individuals to access organizational information. Therefore, it is important for 
information systems to be able to limit the ability to create or modify security attributes to 
authorized individuals only.

AC-17 REMOTE ACCESS 
Control:  The organization: 
a. Establishes and documents usage restrictions, configuration/connection requirements, and 
implementation guidance for each type of remote access allowed; and 
b. Authorizes remote access to the information system prior to allowing such connections. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Remote access is access to organizational information systems by users (or 
processes acting on behalf of users) communicating through external networks (e.g., the Internet). 
Remote access methods include, for example, dial-up, broadband, and wireless. Organizations 
often employ encrypted virtual private networks (VPNs) to enhance confidentiality and integrity 
over remote connections. The use of encrypted VPNs does not make the access non-remote; 
however, the use of VPNs, when adequately provisioned with appropriate security controls (e.g., 
employing appropriate encryption techniques for confidentiality and integrity protection) may 
provide sufficient assurance to the organization that it can effectively treat such connections as 
internal networks.  Still, VPN connections traverse external networks, and the encrypted VPN 
does not enhance the availability of remote connections. Also, VPNs with encrypted tunnels can 
affect the organizational capability to adequately monitor network communications traffic for 
malicious code. Remote access controls apply to information systems other than public web 
servers or systems designed for public access. This control addresses authorization prior to 
allowing remote access without specifying the formats for such authorization. While organizations 
may use interconnection security agreements to authorize remote access connections, such 
agreements are not required by this control. Enforcing access restrictions for remote connections is 
addressed in AC-3. Related controls: AC-2, AC-3, AC-18, AC-19, AC-20, CA-3, CA-7, CM-8, 
IA-2, IA-3, IA-8, MA-4, PE-17, PL-4, SC-10, SI-4. 
Control Enhancements: 
(1) REMOTE ACCESS | AUTOMATED MONITORING / CONTROL  
The information system monitors and controls remote access methods. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Automated monitoring and control of remote access sessions allows 
organizations to detect cyber attacks and also ensure ongoing compliance with remote access 
policies by auditing connection activities of remote users on a variety of information system 
components (e.g., servers, workstations, notebook computers, smart phones, and tablets). 
Related controls: AU-2, AU-12. 
(2) REMOTE ACCESS | PROTECTION OF CONFIDENTIALITY / INTEGRITY USING ENCRYPTION  
The information system implements cryptographic mechanisms to protect the confidentiality and 
integrity of remote access sessions. 
Supplemental Guidance:  The encryption strength of mechanism is selected based on the security 
categorization of the information.  Related controls: SC-8, SC-12, SC-13.

(3) REMOTE ACCESS | MANAGED ACCESS CONTROL POINTS  
The information system routes all remote accesses through [Assignment: organization-defined 
number] managed network access control points. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Limiting the number of access control points for remote accesses 
reduces the attack surface for organizations. Organizations consider the Trusted Internet 
Connections (TIC) initiative requirements for external network connections. Related control: 
SC-7. 
(4) REMOTE ACCESS | PRIVILEGED COMMANDS / ACCESS  
The organization: 
(a) Authorizes the execution of privileged commands and access to security-relevant information 
via remote access only for [Assignment: organization-defined needs]; and 
(b) Documents the rationale for such access in the security plan for the information system. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Related control: AC-6.

(9) REMOTE ACCESS | DISCONNECT / DISABLE ACCESS  
The organization provides the capability to expeditiously disconnect or disable remote access to 
the information system within [Assignment: organization-defined time period]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  This control enhancement requires organizations to have the capability 
to rapidly disconnect current users remotely accessing the information system and/or disable 
further remote access. The speed of disconnect or disablement varies based on the criticality 
of missions/business functions and the need to eliminate immediate or future remote access to 
organizational information systems.

b. Authorizes wireless access to the information system prior to allowing such connections. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Wireless technologies include, for example, microwave, packet radio 
(UHF/VHF), 802.11x, and Bluetooth. Wireless networks use authentication protocols (e.g., 
EAP/TLS, PEAP), which provide credential protection and mutual authentication. Related

Supplemental Guidance:  Related control: AC-19. 
(4) WIRELESS ACCESS | RESTRICT CONFIGURATIONS BY USERS  
The organization identifies and explicitly authorizes users allowed to independently configure 
wireless networking capabilities. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Organizational authorizations to allow selected users to configure 
wireless networking capability are enforced in part, by the access enforcement mechanisms 
employed within organizational information systems. Related controls: AC-3, SC-15. 
(5) WIRELESS ACCESS | ANTENNAS / TRANSMISSION POWER LEVELS  
The organization selects radio antennas and calibrates transmission power levels to reduce the 
probability that usable signals can be received outside of organization-controlled boundaries. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Actions that may be taken by organizations to limit unauthorized use 
of wireless communications outside of organization-controlled boundaries include, for 
example: (i) reducing the power of wireless transmissions so that the transmissions are less 
likely to emit a signal that can be used by adversaries outside of the physical perimeters of 
organizations; (ii) employing measures such as TEMPEST to control wireless emanations; 
and (iii) using directional/beam forming antennas that reduce the likelihood that unintended 
receivers will be able to intercept signals. Prior to taking such actions, organizations can 
conduct periodic wireless surveys to understand the radio frequency profile of organizational 
information systems as well as other systems that may be operating in the area. Related 
control: PE-19.

AC-19 ACCESS CONTROL FOR MOBILE DEVICES 
Control:  The organization: 
a. Establishes usage restrictions, configuration requirements, connection requirements, and 
implementation guidance for organization-controlled mobile devices; and 
b. Authorizes the connection of mobile devices to organizational information systems. 
Supplemental Guidance:  A mobile device is a computing device that: (i) has a small form factor 
such that it can easily be carried by a single individual; (ii) is designed to operate without a 
physical connection (e.g., wirelessly transmit or receive information); (iii) possesses local, non-
removable or removable data storage; and (iv) includes a self-contained power source. Mobile 
devices may also include voice communication capabilities, on-board sensors that allow the device 
to capture information, and/or built-in features for synchronizing local data with remote locations. 
Examples include smart phones, E-readers, and tablets. Mobile devices are typically associated 
with a single individual and the device is usually in close proximity to the individual; however, the 
degree of proximity can vary depending upon on the form factor and size of the device. The

processing, storage, and transmission capability of the mobile device may be comparable to or 
merely a subset of desktop systems, depending upon the nature and intended purpose of the 
device. Due to the large variety of mobile devices with different technical characteristics and 
capabilities, organizational restrictions may vary for the different classes/types of such devices. 
Usage restrictions and specific implementation guidance for mobile devices include, for example, 
configuration management, device identification and authentication, implementation of mandatory 
protective software (e.g., malicious code detection, firewall), scanning devices for malicious code, 
updating virus protection software, scanning for critical software updates and patches, conducting 
primary operating system (and possibly other resident software) integrity checks, and disabling 
unnecessary hardware (e.g., wireless, infrared). Organizations are cautioned that the need to 
provide adequate security for mobile devices goes beyond the requirements in this control. Many 
safeguards and countermeasures for mobile devices are reflected in other security controls in the 
catalog allocated in the initial control baselines as starting points for the development of security 
plans and overlays using the tailoring process. There may also be some degree of overlap in the 
requirements articulated by the security controls within the different families of controls. AC-20 
addresses mobile devices that are not organization-controlled. Related controls: AC-3, AC-7, AC-

(b) Enforces the following restrictions on individuals permitted by the authorizing official to use 
unclassified mobile devices in facilities containing information systems processing, storing, 
or transmitting classified information: 
(1) Connection of unclassified mobile devices to classified information systems is 
prohibited; 
(2) Connection of unclassified mobile devices to unclassified information systems requires 
approval from the authorizing official; 
(3) Use of internal or external modems or wireless interfaces within the unclassified mobile 
devices is prohibited; and 
(4) Unclassified mobile devices and the information stored on those devices are subject to 
random reviews and inspections by [Assignment: organization-defined security officials], 
and if classified information is found, the incident handling policy is followed. 
(c) Restricts the connection of classified mobile devices to classified information systems in

AC-20 USE OF EXTERNAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS 
Control:  The organization establishes terms and conditions, consistent with any trust relationships 
established with other organizations owning, operating, and/or maintaining external information 
systems, allowing authorized individuals to: 
a. Access the information system from external information systems; and 
b. Process, store, or transmit organization-controlled information using external information 
systems. 
Supplemental Guidance:  External information systems are information systems or components of 
information systems that are outside of the authorization boundary established by organizations 
and for which organizations typically have no direct supervision and authority over the application 
of required security controls or the assessment of control effectiveness. External information 
systems include, for example: (i) personally owned information systems/devices (e.g., notebook 
computers, smart phones, tablets, personal digital assistants); (ii) privately owned computing and 
communications devices resident in commercial or public facilities (e.g., hotels, train stations, 
convention centers, shopping malls, or airports); (iii) information systems owned or controlled by 
nonfederal governmental organizations; and (iv) federal information systems that are not owned 
by, operated by, or under the direct supervision and authority of organizations. This control also 
addresses the use of external information systems for the processing, storage, or transmission of 
organizational information, including, for example, accessing cloud services (e.g., infrastructure as 
a service, platform as a service, or software as a service) from organizational information systems. 
 For some external information systems (i.e., information systems operated by other federal 
agencies, including organizations subordinate to those agencies), the trust relationships that have 
been established between those organizations and the originating organization may be such, that 
no explicit terms and conditions are required. Information systems within these organizations 
would not be considered external. These situations occur when, for example, there are pre-existing 
sharing/trust agreements (either implicit or explicit) established between federal agencies or 
organizations subordinate to those agencies, or when such trust agreements are specified by 
applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives, or policies. Authorized individuals include, for 
example, organizational personnel, contractors, or other individuals with authorized access to 
organizational information systems and over which organizations have the authority to impose 
rules of behavior with regard to system access. Restrictions that organizations impose on 
authorized individuals need not be uniform, as those restrictions may vary depending upon the 
trust relationships between organizations. Therefore, organizations may choose to impose different 
security restrictions on contractors than on state, local, or tribal governments. 
This control does not apply to the use of external information systems to access public interfaces 
to organizational information systems (e.g., individuals accessing federal information through 
www.usa.gov). Organizations establish terms and conditions for the use of external information 
systems in accordance with organizational security policies and procedures. Terms and conditions 
address as a minimum: types of applications that can be accessed on organizational information 
systems from external information systems; and the highest security category of information that 
can be processed, stored, or transmitted on external information systems. If terms and conditions 
with the owners of external information systems cannot be established, organizations may impose 
restrictions on organizational personnel using those external systems. Related controls: AC-3, AC-
17, AC-19, CA-3, PL-4, SA-9.

APPENDIX F-AC   PAGE F-33 
Control Enhancements: 
(1) USE OF EXTERNAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS | LIMITS ON AUTHORIZED USE  
The organization permits authorized individuals to use an external information system to access 
the information system or to process, store, or transmit organization-controlled information only 
when the organization: 
(a) Verifies the implementation of required security controls on the external system as specified 
in the organization’s information security policy and security plan; or 
(b) Retains approved information system connection or processing agreements with the 
organizational entity hosting the external information system. 
Supplemental Guidance:  This control enhancement recognizes that there are circumstances 
where individuals using external information systems (e.g., contractors, coalition partners) 
need to access organizational information systems. In those situations, organizations need 
confidence that the external information systems contain the necessary security safeguards 
(i.e., security controls), so as not to compromise, damage, or otherwise harm organizational 
information systems. Verification that the required security controls have been implemented 
can be achieved, for example, by third-party, independent assessments, attestations, or other 
means, depending on the confidence level required by organizations. Related control: CA-2. 
(2) USE OF EXTERNAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS | PORTABLE STORAGE DEVICES 
The organization [Selection: restricts; prohibits] the use of organization-controlled portable 
storage devices by authorized individuals on external information systems. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Limits on the use of organization-controlled portable storage devices 
in external information systems include, for example, complete prohibition of the use of such 
devices or restrictions on how the devices may be used and under what conditions the devices 
may be used. 
(3) USE OF EXTERNAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS | NON-ORGANIZATIONALLY OWNED SYSTEMS / COMPONENTS / DEVICES  
The organization [Selection: restricts; prohibits] the use of non-organizationally owned information 
systems, system components, or devices to process, store, or transmit organizational information. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Non-organizationally owned devices include devices owned by other 
organizations (e.g., federal/state agencies, contractors) and personally owned devices. There 
are risks to using non-organizationally owned devices. In some cases, the risk is sufficiently 
high as to prohibit such use. In other cases, it may be such that the use of non-organizationally 
owned devices is allowed but restricted in some way. Restrictions include, for example: (i) 
requiring the implementation of organization-approved security controls prior to authorizing 
such connections; (ii) limiting access to certain types of information, services, or applications; 
(iii) using virtualization techniques to limit processing and storage activities to servers or 
other system components provisioned by the organization; and (iv) agreeing to terms and 
conditions for usage. For personally owned devices, organizations consult with the Office of 
the General Counsel regarding legal issues associated with using such devices in operational 
environments, including, for example, requirements for conducting forensic analyses during

AC-21 INFORMATION SHARING 
Control:  The organization: 
a. Facilitates information sharing by enabling authorized users to determine whether access 
authorizations assigned to the sharing partner match the access restrictions on the information 
for [Assignment: organization-defined information sharing circumstances where user 
discretion is required]; and 
b. Employs [Assignment: organization-defined automated mechanisms or manual processes] to 
assist users in making information sharing/collaboration decisions. 
Supplemental Guidance:  This control applies to information that may be restricted in some manner 
(e.g., privileged medical information, contract-sensitive information, proprietary information, 
personally identifiable information, classified information related to special access programs or 
compartments) based on some formal or administrative determination. Depending on the particular 
information-sharing circumstances, sharing partners may be defined at the individual, group, or 
organizational level. Information may be defined by content, type, security category, or special 
access program/compartment. Related control: AC-3. 
 Control Enhancements:

AC-22 PUBLICLY ACCESSIBLE CONTENT 
Control:  The organization: 
a. Designates individuals authorized to post information onto a publicly accessible information 
system; 
b. Trains authorized individuals to ensure that publicly accessible information does not contain 
nonpublic information; 
c. Reviews the proposed content of information prior to posting onto the publicly accessible 
information system to ensure that nonpublic information is not included; and 
d. Reviews the content on the publicly accessible information system for nonpublic information 
[Assignment: organization-defined frequency] and removes such information, if discovered. 
Supplemental Guidance:  In accordance with federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, 
regulations, standards, and/or guidance, the general public is not authorized access to nonpublic 
information (e.g., information protected under the Privacy Act and proprietary information). This 
control addresses information systems that are controlled by the organization and accessible to the 
general public, typically without identification or authentication. The posting of information on 
non-organization information systems is covered by organizational policy. Related controls: AC-3,

AC-23 DATA MINING PROTECTION 
Control:  The organization employs [Assignment: organization-defined data mining prevention and 
detection techniques] for [Assignment: organization-defined data storage objects] to adequately 
detect and protect against data mining. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Data storage objects include, for example, databases, database records, and 
database fields. Data mining prevention and detection techniques include, for example: (i) limiting 
the types of responses provided to database queries; (ii) limiting the number/frequency of database 
queries to increase the work factor needed to determine the contents of such databases; and (iii) 
notifying organizational personnel when atypical database queries or accesses occur. This control 
focuses on the protection of organizational information from data mining while such information 
resides in organizational data stores. In contrast, AU-13 focuses on monitoring for organizational 
information that may have been mined or otherwise obtained from data stores and is now available 
as open source information residing on external sites, for example, through social networking or 
social media websites.

AC-24 ACCESS CONTROL DECISIONS 
Control:  The organization establishes procedures to ensure [Assignment: organization-defined 
access control decisions] are applied to each access request prior to access enforcement. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Access control decisions (also known as authorization decisions) occur 
when authorization information is applied to specific accesses. In contrast, access enforcement 
occurs when information systems enforce access control decisions. While it is very common to 
have access control decisions and access enforcement implemented by the same entity, it is not 
required and it is not always an optimal implementation choice. For some architectures and 
distributed information systems, different entities may perform access control decisions and access 
enforcement. 
 Control Enhancements: 
(1) ACCESS CONTROL DECISIONS | TRANSMIT ACCESS AUTHORIZATION INFORMATION  
The information system transmits [Assignment: organization-defined access authorization 
information] using [Assignment: organization-defined security safeguards] to [Assignment: 
organization-defined information systems] that enforce access control decisions. 
Supplemental Guidance:  In distributed information systems, authorization processes and access 
control decisions may occur in separate parts of the systems. In such instances, authorization 
information is transmitted securely so timely access control decisions can be enforced at the 
appropriate locations. To support the access control decisions, it may be necessary to transmit 
as part of the access authorization information, supporting security attributes. This is due to 
the fact that in distributed information systems, there are various access control decisions that 
need to be made and different entities (e.g., services) make these decisions in a serial fashion, 
each requiring some security attributes to make the decisions. Protecting access authorization

information (i.e., access control decisions) ensures that such information cannot be altered, 
spoofed, or otherwise compromised during transmission. 
(2) ACCESS CONTROL DECISIONS | NO USER OR PROCESS IDENTITY 
The information system enforces access control decisions based on [Assignment: organization-
defined security attributes] that do not include the identity of the user or process acting on behalf 
of the user. 
Supplemental Guidance:  In certain situations, it is important that access control decisions can be 
made without information regarding the identity of the users issuing the requests. These are 
generally instances where preserving individual privacy is of paramount importance. In other 
situations, user identification information is simply not needed for access control decisions 
and, especially in the case of distributed information systems, transmitting such information 
with the needed degree of assurance may be very expensive or difficult to accomplish.

AC-25 REFERENCE MONITOR  
 Control:  The information system implements a reference monitor for [Assignment: organization-
defined access control policies] that is tamperproof, always invoked, and small enough to be 
subject to analysis and testing, the completeness of which can be assured. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Information is represented internally within information systems using 
abstractions known as data structures. Internal data structures can represent different types of 
entities, both active and passive. Active entities, also known as subjects, are typically associated 
with individuals, devices, or processes acting on behalf of individuals. Passive entities, also known 
as objects, are typically associated with data structures such as records, buffers, tables, files, inter-
process pipes, and communications ports. Reference monitors typically enforce mandatory access 
control policies—a type of access control that restricts access to objects based on the identity of 
subjects or groups to which the subjects belong. The access controls are mandatory because 
subjects with certain privileges (i.e., access permissions) are restricted from passing those 
privileges on to any other subjects, either directly or indirectly—that is, the information system 
strictly enforces the access control policy based on the rule set established by the policy. The 
tamperproof property of the reference monitor prevents adversaries from compromising the 
functioning of the mechanism. The always invoked property prevents adversaries from bypassing 
the mechanism and hence violating the security policy. The smallness property helps to ensure the 
completeness in the analysis and testing of the mechanism to detect weaknesses or deficiencies 
(i.e., latent flaws) that would prevent the enforcement of the security policy. Related controls: AC-

2.  Procedures to facilitate the implementation of the security awareness and training policy 
and associated security awareness and training controls; and 
b. Reviews and updates the current: 
1. Security awareness and training policy [Assignment: organization-defined frequency]; 
and 
2.  Security awareness and training procedures [Assignment: organization-defined

Supplemental Guidance:  This control addresses the establishment of policy and procedures for the 
effective implementation of selected security controls and control enhancements in the AT family. 
Policy and procedures reflect applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, 
policies, standards, and guidance. Security program policies and procedures at the organization 
level may make the need for system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The policy can 
be included as part of the general information security policy for organizations or conversely, can 
be represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex nature of certain organizations. The 
procedures can be established for the security program in general and for particular information 
systems, if needed. The organizational risk management strategy is a key factor in establishing 
policy and procedures. Related control: PM-9.

information not required for job performance, unexplained access to financial resources, 
bullying or sexual harassment of fellow employees, workplace violence, and other serious 
violations of organizational policies, procedures, directives, rules, or practices. Security 
awareness training includes how to communicate employee and management concerns 
regarding potential indicators of insider threat through appropriate organizational channels in 
accordance with established organizational policies and procedures. Related controls: PL-4,

roles and responsibilities: 
a. Before authorizing access to the information system or performing assigned duties; 
b. When required by information system changes; and 
c. [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] thereafter. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Organizations determine the appropriate content of security training based 
on the assigned roles and responsibilities of individuals and the specific security requirements of 
organizations and the information systems to which personnel have authorized access. In addition, 
organizations provide enterprise architects, information system developers, software developers, 
acquisition/procurement officials, information system managers, system/network administrators, 
personnel conducting configuration management and auditing activities, personnel performing 
independent verification and validation activities, security control assessors, and other personnel 
having access to system-level software, adequate security-related technical training specifically 
tailored for their assigned duties. Comprehensive role-based training addresses management, 
operational, and technical roles and responsibilities covering physical, personnel, and technical 
safeguards and countermeasures. Such training can include for example, policies, procedures, 
tools, and artifacts for the organizational security roles defined. Organizations also provide the 
training necessary for individuals to carry out their responsibilities related to operations and 
supply chain security within the context of organizational information security programs. Role-

detection devices/systems, sprinkler systems, handheld fire extinguishers, fixed fire hoses, 
smoke detectors, temperature/humidity, HVAC, and power within the facility. Organizations 
identify personnel with specific roles and responsibilities associated with environmental 
controls requiring specialized training. Related controls: PE-1, PE-13, PE-14, PE-15. 
(2) SECURITY TRAINING | PHYSICAL SECURITY CONTROLS 
The organization provides [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles] with initial and 
[Assignment: organization-defined frequency] training in the employment and operation of 
physical security controls. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Physical security controls include, for example, physical access control 
devices, physical intrusion alarms, monitoring/surveillance equipment, and security guards 
(deployment and operating procedures). Organizations identify personnel with specific roles 
and responsibilities associated with physical security controls requiring specialized training. 
Related controls: PE-2, PE-3, PE-4, PE-5. 
(3) SECURITY TRAINING | PRACTICAL EXERCISES 
The organization includes practical exercises in security training that reinforce training objectives. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Practical exercises may include, for example, security training for 
software developers that includes simulated cyber attacks exploiting common software 
vulnerabilities (e.g., buffer overflows), or spear/whale phishing attacks targeted at senior 
leaders/executives. These types of practical exercises help developers better understand the 
effects of such vulnerabilities and appreciate the need for security coding standards and 
processes. 
(4) SECURITY TRAINING | SUSPICIOUS COMMUNICATIONS AND ANOMALOUS SYSTEM BEHAVIOR 
The organization provides training to its personnel on [Assignment: organization-defined 
indicators of malicious code] to recognize suspicious communications and anomalous behavior in 
organizational information systems. 
Supplemental Guidance:  A well-trained workforce provides another organizational safeguard 
that can be employed as part of a defense-in-depth strategy to protect organizations against 
malicious code coming in to organizations via email or the web applications. Personnel are 
trained to look for indications of potentially suspicious email (e.g., receiving an unexpected 
email, receiving an email containing strange or poor grammar, or receiving an email from an 
unfamiliar sender but who appears to be from a known sponsor or contractor). Personnel are 
also trained on how to respond to such suspicious email or web communications (e.g., not 
opening attachments, not clicking on embedded web links, and checking the source of email 
addresses). For this process to work effectively, all organizational personnel are trained and 
made aware of what constitutes suspicious communications. Training personnel on how to 
recognize anomalous behaviors in organizational information systems can potentially provide 
early warning for the presence of malicious code. Recognition of such anomalous behavior by 
organizational personnel can supplement automated malicious code detection and protection 
tools and systems employed by organizations.

[Assignment: organization-defined auditable events]; 
b. Coordinates the security audit function with other organizational entities requiring audit-
related information to enhance mutual support and to help guide the selection of auditable 
events;

[Assignment: organization-defined audited events (the subset of the auditable events defined 
in AU-2 a.) along with the frequency of (or situation requiring) auditing for each identified 
event].

the security of information systems and the environments in which those systems operate in order 
to meet specific and ongoing audit needs. Audit events can include, for example, password 
changes, failed logons, or failed accesses related to information systems, administrative privilege 
usage, PIV credential usage, or third-party credential usage. In determining the set of auditable 
events, organizations consider the auditing appropriate for each of the security controls to be 
implemented. To balance auditing requirements with other information system needs, this control 
also requires identifying that subset of auditable events that are audited at a given point in time. 
For example, organizations may determine that information systems must have the capability to 
log every file access both successful and unsuccessful, but not activate that capability except for 
specific circumstances due to the potential burden on system performance. Auditing requirements, 
including the need for auditable events, may be referenced in other security controls and control 
enhancements. Organizations also include auditable events that are required by applicable federal 
laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, and standards. Audit records can be 
generated at various levels of abstraction, including at the packet level as information traverses the 
network. Selecting the appropriate level of abstraction is a critical aspect of an audit capability and 
can facilitate the identification of root causes to problems. Organizations consider in the definition 
of auditable events, the auditing necessary to cover related events such as the steps in distributed, 
transaction-based processes (e.g., processes that are distributed across multiple organizations) and 
actions that occur in service-oriented architectures. Related controls: AC-6, AC-17, AU-3, AU-12,

Control Enhancements: 
(1) CONTENT OF AUDIT RECORDS | ADDITIONAL AUDIT INFORMATION  
The information system generates audit records containing the following additional information: 
[Assignment: organization-defined additional, more detailed information]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Detailed information that organizations may consider in audit records 
includes, for example, full text recording of privileged commands or the individual identities 
of group account users. Organizations consider limiting the additional audit information to 
only that information explicitly needed for specific audit requirements. This facilitates the use 
of audit trails and audit logs by not including information that could potentially be misleading 
or could make it more difficult to locate information of interest.

The information system provides centralized management and configuration of the content to be 
captured in audit records generated by [Assignment: organization-defined information system 
components]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  This control enhancement requires that the content to be captured in 
audit records be configured from a central location (necessitating automation). Organizations 
coordinate the selection of required audit content to support the centralized management and 
configuration capability provided by the information system. Related controls: AU-6, AU-7.

AU-4 AUDIT STORAGE CAPACITY 
Control:  The organization allocates audit record storage capacity in accordance with [Assignment: 
organization-defined audit record storage requirements]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Organizations consider the types of auditing to be performed and the audit 
processing requirements when allocating audit storage capacity. Allocating sufficient audit storage 
capacity reduces the likelihood of such capacity being exceeded and resulting in the potential loss 
or reduction of auditing capability. Related controls: AU-2, AU-5, AU-6, AU-7, AU-11, SI-4. 
Control Enhancements: 
(1) AUDIT STORAGE CAPACITY | TRANSFER TO ALTERNATE STORAGE  
The information system off-loads audit records [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] onto 
a different system or media than the system being audited. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Off-loading is a process designed to preserve the confidentiality and 
integrity of audit records by moving the records from the primary information system to a 
secondary or alternate system. It is a common process in information systems with limited 
audit storage capacity; the audit storage is used only in a transitory fashion until the system 
can communicate with the secondary or alternate system designated for storing the audit 
records, at which point the information is transferred.

AU-5 RESPONSE TO AUDIT PROCESSING FAILURES 
Control:  The information system: 
a. Alerts [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles] in the event of an audit 
processing failure; and 
b. Takes the following additional actions: [Assignment: organization-defined actions to be taken 
(e.g., shut down information system, overwrite oldest audit records, stop generating audit 
records)]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Audit processing failures include, for example, software/hardware errors, 
failures in the audit capturing mechanisms, and audit storage capacity being reached or exceeded. 
Organizations may choose to define additional actions for different audit processing failures (e.g., 
by type, by location, by severity, or a combination of such factors). This control applies to each 
audit data storage repository (i.e., distinct information system component where audit records are 
stored), the total audit storage capacity of organizations (i.e., all audit data storage repositories 
combined), or both. Related controls: AU-4, SI-12. 
Control Enhancements: 
(1) RESPONSE TO AUDIT PROCESSING FAILURES | AUDIT STORAGE CAPACITY  
The information system provides a warning to [Assignment: organization-defined personnel, roles, 
and/or locations] within [Assignment: organization-defined time period] when allocated audit 
record storage volume reaches [Assignment: organization-defined percentage] of repository 
maximum audit record storage capacity. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Organizations may have multiple audit data storage repositories 
distributed across multiple information system components, with each repository having 
different storage volume capacities. 
(2) RESPONSE TO AUDIT PROCESSING FAILURES | REAL-TIME ALERTS  
The information system provides an alert in [Assignment: organization-defined real-time period] to 
[Assignment: organization-defined personnel, roles, and/or locations] when the following audit 
failure events occur: [Assignment: organization-defined audit failure events requiring real-time 
alerts]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Alerts provide organizations with urgent messages. Real-time alerts 
provide these messages at information technology speed (i.e., the time from event detection to 
alert occurs in seconds or less). 
(3) RESPONSE TO AUDIT PROCESSING FAILURES | CONFIGURABLE TRAFFIC VOLUME THRESHOLDS  
The information system enforces configurable network communications traffic volume thresholds 
reflecting limits on auditing capacity and [Selection: rejects; delays] network traffic above those 
thresholds. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Organizations have the capability to reject or delay the processing of 
network communications traffic if auditing such traffic is determined to exceed the storage 
capacity of the information system audit function. The rejection or delay response is triggered 
by the established organizational traffic volume thresholds which can be adjusted based on 
changes to audit storage capacity.   
(4) RESPONSE TO AUDIT PROCESSING FAILURES | SHUTDOWN ON FAILURE  
The information system invokes a [Selection: full system shutdown; partial system shutdown; 
degraded operational mode with limited mission/business functionality available] in the event of 
[Assignment: organization-defined audit failures], unless an alternate audit capability exists. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Organizations determine the types of audit failures that can trigger 
automatic information system shutdowns or degraded operations. Because of the importance 
of ensuring mission/business continuity, organizations may determine that the nature of the 
audit failure is not so severe that it warrants a complete shutdown of the information system 
supporting the core organizational missions/business operations. In those instances, partial 
information system shutdowns or operating in a degraded mode with reduced capability may 
be viable alternatives. Related control: AU-15.

AU-6 AUDIT REVIEW, ANALYSIS, AND REPORTING 
Control:  The organization: 
a. Reviews and analyzes information system audit records [Assignment: organization-defined 
frequency] for indications of [Assignment: organization-defined inappropriate or unusual 
activity]; and 
b. Reports findings to [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Audit review, analysis, and reporting covers information security-related 
auditing performed by organizations including, for example, auditing that results from monitoring 
of account usage, remote access, wireless connectivity, mobile device connection, configuration 
settings, system component inventory, use of maintenance tools and nonlocal maintenance, 
physical access, temperature and humidity, equipment delivery and removal, communications at 
the information system boundaries, use of mobile code, and use of VoIP. Findings can be reported 
to organizational entities that include, for example, incident response team, help desk, information 
security group/department. If organizations are prohibited from reviewing and analyzing audit 
information or unable to conduct such activities (e.g., in certain national security applications or 
systems), the review/analysis may be carried out by other organizations granted such authority.

Control Enhancements: 
(1) AUDIT REVIEW, ANALYSIS, AND REPORTING | PROCESS INTEGRATION  
The organization employs automated mechanisms to integrate audit review, analysis, and 
reporting processes to support organizational processes for investigation and response to 
suspicious activities. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Organizational processes benefiting from integrated audit review, 
analysis, and reporting include, for example, incident response, continuous monitoring, 
contingency planning, and Inspector General audits. Related controls: AU-12, PM-7. 
(2) AUDIT REVIEW, ANALYSIS, AND REPORTING | AUTOMATED SECURITY ALERTS  
[Withdrawn: Incorporated into SI-4].  
(3) AUDIT REVIEW, ANALYSIS, AND REPORTING | CORRELATE AUDIT REPOSITORIES  
The organization analyzes and correlates audit records across different repositories to gain 
organization-wide situational awareness. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Organization-wide situational awareness includes awareness across all 
three tiers of risk management (i.e., organizational, mission/business process, and information 
system) and supports cross-organization awareness. Related controls: AU-12, IR-4. 
(4) AUDIT REVIEW, ANALYSIS, AND REPORTING | CENTRAL REVIEW AND ANALYSIS  
The information system provides the capability to centrally review and analyze audit records from 
multiple components within the system. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Automated mechanisms for centralized reviews and analyses include, 
for example, Security Information Management products.  Related controls: AU-2, AU-12. 
(5) AUDIT REVIEW, ANALYSIS, AND REPORTING | INTEGRATION / SCANNING AND MONITORING CAPABILITIES  
The organization integrates analysis of audit records with analysis of [Selection (one or more): 
vulnerability scanning information; performance data; information system monitoring information; 
[Assignment: organization-defined data/information collected from other sources]] to further 
enhance the ability to identify inappropriate or unusual activity.

________________________________________________________________________________________________ 
APPENDIX F-AU   PAGE F-46 
Supplemental Guidance:  This control enhancement does not require vulnerability scanning, the 
generation of performance data, or information system monitoring. Rather, the enhancement 
requires that the analysis of information being otherwise produced in these areas is integrated 
with the analysis of audit information. Security Event and Information Management System 
tools can facilitate audit record aggregation/consolidation from multiple information system 
components as well as audit record correlation and analysis. The use of standardized audit 
record analysis scripts developed by organizations (with localized script adjustments, as 
necessary) provides more cost-effective approaches for analyzing audit record information 
collected. The correlation of audit record information with vulnerability scanning information 
is important in determining the veracity of vulnerability scans and correlating attack detection 
events with scanning results. Correlation with performance data can help uncover denial of 
service attacks or cyber attacks resulting in unauthorized use of resources. Correlation with 
system monitoring information can assist in uncovering attacks and in better relating audit 
information to operational situations. Related controls: AU-12, IR-4, RA-5. 
(6) AUDIT REVIEW, ANALYSIS, AND REPORTING | CORRELATION WITH PHYSICAL MONITORING  
The organization correlates information from audit records with information obtained from 
monitoring physical access to further enhance the ability to identify suspicious, inappropriate, 
unusual, or malevolent activity. 
Supplemental Guidance:  The correlation of physical audit information and audit logs from 
information systems may assist organizations in identifying examples of suspicious behavior 
or supporting evidence of such behavior. For example, the correlation of an individual’s 
identify for logical access to certain information systems with the additional physical security 
information that the individual was actually present at the facility when the logical access 
occurred, may prove to be useful in investigations. 
(7) AUDIT REVIEW, ANALYSIS, AND REPORTING | PERMITTED ACTIONS  
The organization specifies the permitted actions for each [Selection (one or more): information 
system process; role; user] associated with the review, analysis, and reporting of audit 
information. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Organizations specify permitted actions for information system 
processes, roles, and/or users associated with the review, analysis, and reporting of audit 
records through account management techniques. Specifying permitted actions on audit 
information is a way to enforce the principle of least privilege. Permitted actions are enforced 
by the information system and include, for example, read, write, execute, append, and delete. 
(8) AUDIT REVIEW, ANALYSIS, AND REPORTING | FULL TEXT ANALYSIS OF PRIVILEGED COMMANDS  
The organization performs a full text analysis of audited privileged commands in a physically 
distinct component or subsystem of the information system, or other information system that is 
dedicated to that analysis. 
Supplemental Guidance:  This control enhancement requires a distinct environment for the 
dedicated analysis of audit information related to privileged users without compromising such 
information on the information system where the users have elevated privileges including the 
capability to execute privileged commands. Full text analysis refers to analysis that considers 
the full text of privileged commands (i.e., commands and all parameters) as opposed to 
analysis that considers only the name of the command. Full text analysis includes, for 
example, the use of pattern matching and heuristics. Related controls: AU-3, AU-9, AU-11, 
AU-12. 
(9) AUDIT REVIEW, ANALYSIS, AND REPORTING | CORRELATION WITH INFORMATION FROM NONTECHNICAL SOURCES  
The organization correlates information from nontechnical sources with audit information to 
enhance organization-wide situational awareness. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Nontechnical sources include, for example, human resources records 
documenting organizational policy violations (e.g., sexual harassment incidents, improper use 
of organizational information assets). Such information can lead organizations to a more 
directed analytical effort to detect potential malicious insider activity. Due to the sensitive 
nature of the information available from nontechnical sources, organizations limit access to 
such information to minimize the potential for the inadvertent release of privacy-related 
information to individuals that do not have a need to know. Thus, correlation of information

The organization adjusts the level of audit review, analysis, and reporting within the information 
system when there is a change in risk based on law enforcement information, intelligence 
information, or other credible sources of information. 
Supplemental Guidance:  The frequency, scope, and/or depth of the audit review, analysis, and 
reporting may be adjusted to meet organizational needs based on new information received.

AU-7 AUDIT REDUCTION AND REPORT GENERATION 
 Control:  The information system provides an audit reduction and report generation capability that: 
a. Supports on-demand audit review, analysis, and reporting requirements and after-the-fact 
investigations of security incidents; and 
b. Does not alter the original content or time ordering of audit records. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Audit reduction is a process that manipulates collected audit information 
and organizes such information in a summary format that is more meaningful to analysts. Audit 
reduction and report generation capabilities do not always emanate from the same information 
system or from the same organizational entities conducting auditing activities. Audit reduction 
capability can include, for example, modern data mining techniques with advanced data filters to 
identify anomalous behavior in audit records. The report generation capability provided by the 
information system can generate customizable reports. Time ordering of audit records can be a 
significant issue if the granularity of the timestamp in the record is insufficient. Related control: 
AU-6. 
Control Enhancements: 
(1) AUDIT REDUCTION AND REPORT GENERATION | AUTOMATIC PROCESSING  
The information system provides the capability to process audit records for events of interest 
based on [Assignment: organization-defined audit fields within audit records]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Events of interest can be identified by the content of specific audit 
record fields including, for example, identities of individuals, event types, event locations, 
event times, event dates, system resources involved, IP addresses involved, or information 
objects accessed. Organizations may define audit event criteria to any degree of granularity 
required, for example, locations selectable by general networking location (e.g., by network or 
subnetwork) or selectable by specific information system component. Related controls: AU-2, 
AU-12. 
(2) AUDIT REDUCTION AND REPORT GENERATION | AUTOMATIC SORT AND SEARCH  
The information system provides the capability to sort and search audit records for events of 
interest based on the content of [Assignment: organization-defined audit fields within audit 
records]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Sorting and searching of audit records may be based upon the contents 
of audit record fields, for example: (i) date/time of events; (ii) user identifiers; (iii) Internet 
Protocol (IP) addresses involved in the event; (iv) type of event; or (v) event success/failure.

AU-8 TIME STAMPS 
 Control:  The information system: 
a. Uses internal system clocks to generate time stamps for audit records; and 
b. Records time stamps for audit records that can be mapped to Coordinated Universal Time 
(UTC) or Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) and meets [Assignment: organization-defined 
granularity of time measurement]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Time stamps generated by the information system include date and time. 
Time is commonly expressed in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), a modern continuation of 
Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), or local time with an offset from UTC. Granularity of time 
measurements refers to the degree of synchronization between information system clocks and 
reference clocks, for example, clocks synchronizing within hundreds of milliseconds or within 
tens of milliseconds. Organizations may define different time granularities for different system 
components. Time service can also be critical to other security capabilities such as access control 
and identification and authentication, depending on the nature of the mechanisms used to support 
those capabilities. Related controls: AU-3, AU-12. 
Control Enhancements: 
(1) TIME STAMPS | SYNCHRONIZATION WITH AUTHORITATIVE TIME SOURCE  
The information system:  
(a) Compares the internal information system clocks [Assignment: organization-defined 
frequency] with [Assignment: organization-defined authoritative time source]; and 
(b) Synchronizes the internal system clocks to the authoritative time source when the time 
difference is greater than [Assignment: organization-defined time period]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  This control enhancement provides uniformity of time stamps for 
information systems with multiple system clocks and systems connected over a network. 
(2) TIME STAMPS | SECONDARY AUTHORITATIVE TIME SOURCE  
The information system identifies a secondary authoritative time source that is located in a 
different geographic region than the primary authoritative time source.

Control Enhancements: 
(1) PROTECTION OF AUDIT INFORMATION | HARDWARE WRITE-ONCE MEDIA 
The information system writes audit trails to hardware-enforced, write-once media. 
Supplemental Guidance:  This control enhancement applies to the initial generation of audit 
trails (i.e., the collection of audit records that represents the audit information to be used for 
detection, analysis, and reporting purposes) and to the backup of those audit trails. The 
enhancement does not apply to the initial generation of audit records prior to being written to 
an audit trail. Write-once, read-many (WORM) media includes, for example, Compact Disk-
Recordable (CD-R) and Digital Video Disk-Recordable (DVD-R). In contrast, the use of 
switchable write-protection media such as on tape cartridges or Universal Serial Bus (USB) 
drives results in write-protected, but not write-once, media. Related controls: AU-4, AU-5. 
(2) PROTECTION OF AUDIT INFORMATION | AUDIT BACKUP ON SEPARATE PHYSICAL SYSTEMS / COMPONENTS  
The information system backs up audit records [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] onto 
a physically different system or system component than the system or component being audited. 
Supplemental Guidance:  This control enhancement helps to ensure that a compromise of the 
information system being audited does not also result in a compromise of the audit records. 
Related controls: AU-4, AU-5, AU-11. 
(3) PROTECTION OF AUDIT INFORMATION | CRYPTOGRAPHIC PROTECTION   
The information system implements cryptographic mechanisms to protect the integrity of audit 
information and audit tools. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Cryptographic mechanisms used for protecting the integrity of audit 
information include, for example, signed hash functions using asymmetric cryptography 
enabling distribution of the public key to verify the hash information while maintaining the 
confidentiality of the secret key used to generate the hash. Related controls: AU-10, SC-12, 
SC-13. 
(4) PROTECTION OF AUDIT INFORMATION | ACCESS BY SUBSET OF PRIVILEGED USERS  
The organization authorizes access to management of audit functionality to only [Assignment: 
organization-defined subset of privileged users]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Individuals with privileged access to an information system and who 
are also the subject of an audit by that system, may affect the reliability of audit information 
by inhibiting audit activities or modifying audit records. This control enhancement requires 
that privileged access be further defined between audit-related privileges and other privileges, 
thus limiting the users with audit-related privileges. Related control: AC-5. 
(5) PROTECTION OF AUDIT INFORMATION | DUAL AUTHORIZATION  
The organization enforces dual authorization for [Selection (one or more): movement; deletion] of 
[Assignment: organization-defined audit information]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Organizations may choose different selection options for different 
types of audit information. Dual authorization mechanisms require the approval of two 
authorized individuals in order to execute. Related controls: AC-3, MP-2. 
(6) PROTECTION OF AUDIT INFORMATION | READ ONLY ACCESS  
The organization authorizes read-only access to audit information to [Assignment: organization-
defined subset of privileged users]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Restricting privileged user authorizations to read-only helps to limit 
the potential damage to organizations that could be initiated by such users (e.g., deleting audit 
records to cover up malicious activity).

AU-10 NON-REPUDIATION 
Control:  The information system protects against an individual (or process acting on behalf of an 
individual) falsely denying having performed [Assignment: organization-defined actions to be 
covered by non-repudiation]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Types of individual actions covered by non-repudiation include, for 
example, creating information, sending and receiving messages, approving information (e.g., 
indicating concurrence or signing a contract). Non-repudiation protects individuals against later 
claims by: (i) authors of not having authored particular documents; (ii) senders of not having 
transmitted messages; (iii) receivers of not having received messages; or (iv) signatories of not 
having signed documents. Non-repudiation services can be used to determine if information 
originated from a particular individual, or if an individual took specific actions (e.g., sending an 
email, signing a contract, approving a procurement request) or received specific information. 
Organizations obtain non-repudiation services by employing various techniques or mechanisms 
(e.g., digital signatures, digital message receipts). Related controls: SC-12, SC-8, SC-13, SC-16, 
SC-17, SC-23. 
Control Enhancements: 
(1) NON-REPUDIATION | ASSOCIATION OF IDENTITIES  
The information system: 
(a) Binds the identity of the information producer with the information to [Assignment: 
organization-defined strength of binding]; and 
(b) Provides the means for authorized individuals to determine the identity of the producer of the 
information. 
Supplemental Guidance:  This control enhancement supports audit requirements that provide 
organizational personnel with the means to identify who produced specific information in the 
event of an information transfer. Organizations determine and approve the strength of the 
binding between the information producer and the information based on the security category 
of the information and relevant risk factors. Related controls: AC-4, AC-16. 
(2) NON-REPUDIATION | VALIDATE BINDING OF INFORMATION PRODUCER IDENTITY 
The information system: 
(a) Validates the binding of the information producer identity to the information at [Assignment: 
organization-defined frequency]; and 
(b) Performs [Assignment: organization-defined actions] in the event of a validation error. 
Supplemental Guidance:  This control enhancement prevents the modification of information 
between production and review. The validation of bindings can be achieved, for example, by 
the use of cryptographic checksums. Organizations determine if validations are in response to 
user requests or generated automatically. Related controls: AC-3, AC-4, AC-16. 
(3) NON-REPUDIATION | CHAIN OF CUSTODY  
The information system maintains reviewer/releaser identity and credentials within the established 
chain of custody for all information reviewed or released. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Chain of custody is a process that tracks the movement of evidence 
through its collection, safeguarding, and analysis life cycle by documenting each person who 
handled the evidence, the date and time it was collected or transferred, and the purpose for the 
transfer. If the reviewer is a human or if the review function is automated but separate from 
the release/transfer function, the information system associates the identity of the reviewer of 
the information to be released with the information and the information label. In the case of 
human reviews, this control enhancement provides organizational officials the means to 
identify who reviewed and released the information. In the case of automated reviews, this 
control enhancement ensures that only approved review functions are employed. Related 
controls: AC-4, AC-16.

AU-11 AUDIT RECORD RETENTION 
Control:  The organization retains audit records for [Assignment: organization-defined time period 
consistent with records retention policy] to provide support for after-the-fact investigations of 
security incidents and to meet regulatory and organizational information retention requirements. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Organizations retain audit records until it is determined that they are no 
longer needed for administrative, legal, audit, or other operational purposes. This includes, for 
example, retention and availability of audit records relative to Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) 
requests, subpoenas, and law enforcement actions. Organizations develop standard categories of 
audit records relative to such types of actions and standard response processes for each type of

b. Allows [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles] to select which auditable 
events are to be audited by specific components of the information system; and 
c. Generates audit records for the events defined in AU-2 d. with the content defined in AU-3. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Audit records can be generated from many different information system 
components. The list of audited events is the set of events for which audits are to be generated. 
These events are typically a subset of all events for which the information system is capable of 
generating audit records. Related controls: AC-3, AU-2, AU-3, AU-6, AU-7. 
Control Enhancements: 
(1) AUDIT GENERATION | SYSTEM-WIDE / TIME-CORRELATED AUDIT TRAIL  
The information system compiles audit records from [Assignment: organization-defined 
information system components] into a system-wide (logical or physical) audit trail that is time-
correlated to within [Assignment: organization-defined level of tolerance for relationship between 
time stamps of individual records in the audit trail]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Audit trails are time-correlated if the time stamps in the individual 
audit records can be reliably related to the time stamps in other audit records to achieve a time 
ordering of the records within organizational tolerances. Related controls: AU-8, AU-12. 
(2) AUDIT GENERATION | STANDARDIZED FORMATS  
The information system produces a system-wide (logical or physical) audit trail composed of audit 
records in a standardized format. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Audit information that is normalized to common standards promotes 
interoperability and exchange of such information between dissimilar devices and information 
systems. This facilitates production of event information that can be more readily analyzed 
and correlated. Standard formats for audit records include, for example, system log records 
and audit records compliant with Common Event Expressions (CEE). If logging mechanisms 
within information systems do not conform to standardized formats, systems may convert 
individual audit records into standardized formats when compiling system-wide audit trails. 
(3) AUDIT GENERATION | CHANGES BY AUTHORIZED INDIVIDUALS  
The information system provides the capability for [Assignment: organization-defined individuals 
or roles] to change the auditing to be performed on [Assignment: organization-defined information 
system components] based on [Assignment: organization-defined selectable event criteria] within 
[Assignment: organization-defined time thresholds]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  This control enhancement enables organizations to extend or limit 
auditing as necessary to meet organizational requirements. Auditing that is limited to conserve 
information system resources may be extended to address certain threat situations. In addition, 
auditing may be limited to a specific set of events to facilitate audit reduction, analysis, and 
reporting. Organizations can establish time thresholds in which audit actions are changed, for 
example, near real-time, within minutes, or within hours. Related control: AU-7.

AU-16 CROSS-ORGANIZATIONAL AUDITING 
 Control:  The organization employs [Assignment: organization-defined methods] for coordinating 
[Assignment: organization-defined audit information] among external organizations when audit 
information is transmitted across organizational boundaries. 
Supplemental Guidance:  When organizations use information systems and/or services of external 
organizations, the auditing capability necessitates a coordinated approach across organizations. 
For example, maintaining the identity of individuals that requested particular services across 
organizational boundaries may often be very difficult, and doing so may prove to have significant 
performance ramifications. Therefore, it is often the case that cross-organizational auditing (e.g., 
the type of auditing capability provided by service-oriented architectures) simply captures the 
identity of individuals issuing requests at the initial information system, and subsequent systems 
record that the requests emanated from authorized individuals. Related control: AU-6. 
Control Enhancements: 
(1) CROSS-ORGANIZATIONAL AUDITING | IDENTITY PRESERVATION  
The organization requires that the identity of individuals be preserved in cross-organizational audit 
trails. 
Supplemental Guidance:  This control enhancement applies when there is a need to be able to 
trace actions that are performed across organizational boundaries to a specific individual. 
(2) CROSS-ORGANIZATIONAL AUDITING | SHARING OF AUDIT INFORMATION  
The organization provides cross-organizational audit information to [Assignment: organization-
defined organizations] based on [Assignment: organization-defined cross-organizational sharing 
agreements]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Because of the distributed nature of the audit information, cross-
organization sharing of audit information may be essential for effective analysis of the 
auditing being performed. For example, the audit records of one organization may not provide 
sufficient information to determine the appropriate or inappropriate use of organizational 
information resources by individuals in other organizations. In some instances, only the home 
organizations of individuals have the appropriate knowledge to make such determinations, 
thus requiring the sharing of audit information among organizations.

FAMILY:  SECURITY ASSESSMENT AND AUTHORIZATION 
CA-1 SECURITY ASSESSMENT AND AUTHORIZATION POLICY AND PROCEDURES 
Control:  The organization: 
a. Develops, documents, and disseminates to [Assignment: organization-defined personnel

1. A security assessment and authorization policy that addresses purpose, scope, roles, 
responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among organizational 
entities, and compliance; and 
2. Procedures to facilitate the implementation of the security assessment and 
authorization policy and associated security assessment and authorization controls; 
and 
b. Reviews and updates the current:

Supplemental Guidance:  This control addresses the establishment of policy and procedures for the 
effective implementation of selected security controls and control enhancements in the CA family. 
Policy and procedures reflect applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, 
policies, standards, and guidance. Security program policies and procedures at the organization 
level may make the need for system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The policy can 
be included as part of the general information security policy for organizations or conversely, can 
be represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex nature of certain organizations. The 
procedures can be established for the security program in general and for particular information 
systems, if needed. The organizational risk management strategy is a key factor in establishing 
policy and procedures. Related control: PM-9.

d. Provides the results of the security control assessment to [Assignment: organization-defined 
individuals or roles]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Organizations assess security controls in organizational information 
systems and the environments in which those systems operate as part of: (i) initial and ongoing 
security authorizations; (ii) FISMA annual assessments; (iii) continuous monitoring; and (iv) 
system development life cycle activities. Security assessments: (i) ensure that information security 
is built into organizational information systems; (ii) identify weaknesses and deficiencies early in 
the development process; (iii) provide essential information needed to make risk-based decisions 
as part of security authorization processes; and (iv) ensure compliance to vulnerability mitigation 
procedures. Assessments are conducted on the implemented security controls from Appendix F 
(main catalog) and Appendix G (Program Management controls) as documented in System 
Security Plans and Information Security Program Plans. Organizations can use other types of 
assessment activities such as vulnerability scanning and system monitoring to maintain the 
security posture of information systems during the entire life cycle. Security assessment reports 
document assessment results in sufficient detail as deemed necessary by organizations, to 
determine the accuracy and completeness of the reports and whether the security controls are 
implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to 
meeting security requirements. The FISMA requirement for assessing security controls at least 
annually does not require additional assessment activities to those activities already in place in 
organizational security authorization processes. Security assessment results are provided to the 
individuals or roles appropriate for the types of assessments being conducted. For example, 
assessments conducted in support of security authorization decisions are provided to authorizing 
officials or authorizing official designated representatives. 
To satisfy annual assessment requirements, organizations can use assessment results from the 
following sources: (i) initial or ongoing information system authorizations; (ii) continuous 
monitoring; or (iii)   system development life cycle activities. Organizations ensure that security 
assessment results are current, relevant to the determination of security control effectiveness, and 
obtained with the appropriate level of assessor independence. Existing security control assessment 
results can be reused to the extent that the results are still valid and can also be supplemented with 
additional assessments as needed. Subsequent to initial authorizations and in accordance with 
OMB policy, organizations assess security controls during continuous monitoring. Organizations 
establish the frequency for ongoing security control assessments in accordance with organizational 
continuous monitoring strategies. Information Assurance Vulnerability Alerts provide useful 
examples of vulnerability mitigation procedures. External audits (e.g., audits by external entities 
such as regulatory agencies) are outside the scope of this control. Related controls: CA-5, CA-6, 
CA-7, PM-9, RA-5, SA-11, SA-12, SI-4. 
Control Enhancements: 
(1) SECURITY ASSESSMENTS | INDEPENDENT ASSESSORS 
The organization employs assessors or assessment teams with [Assignment: organization-defined 
level of independence] to conduct security control assessments. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Independent assessors or assessment teams are individuals or groups 
who conduct impartial assessments of organizational information systems. Impartiality 
implies that assessors are free from any perceived or actual conflicts of interest with regard to 
the development, operation, or management of the organizational information systems under 
assessment or to the determination of security control effectiveness. To achieve impartiality, 
assessors should not: (i) create a mutual or conflicting interest with the organizations where 
the assessments are being conducted; (ii) assess their own work; (iii) act as management or 
employees of the organizations they are serving; or (iv) place themselves in positions of 
advocacy for the organizations acquiring their services. Independent assessments can be 
obtained from elements within organizations or can be contracted to public or private sector 
entities outside of organizations. Authorizing officials determine the required level of 
independence based on the security categories of information systems and/or the ultimate risk 
to organizational operations, organizational assets, or individuals. Authorizing officials also 
determine if the level of assessor independence provides sufficient assurance that the results 
Special Publication 800-53 Revision 4                                  Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems 
                                                                                               and Organizations 
________________________________________________________________________________________________ 
APPENDIX F-CA   PAGE F-57 
are sound and can be used to make credible, risk-based decisions. This includes determining 
whether contracted security assessment services have sufficient independence, for example, 
when information system owners are not directly involved in contracting processes or cannot 
unduly influence the impartiality of assessors conducting assessments. In special situations, 
for example, when organizations that own the information systems are small or organizational 
structures require that assessments are conducted by individuals that are in the developmental, 
operational, or management chain of system owners, independence in assessment processes 
can be achieved by ensuring that assessment results are carefully reviewed and analyzed by 
independent teams of experts to validate the completeness, accuracy, integrity, and reliability 
of the results. Organizations recognize that assessments performed for purposes other than 
direct support to authorization decisions are, when performed by assessors with sufficient 
independence, more likely to be useable for such decisions, thereby reducing the need to 
repeat assessments. 
(2) SECURITY ASSESSMENTS | SPECIALIZED ASSESSMENTS 
The organization includes as part of security control assessments, [Assignment: organization-
defined frequency], [Selection: announced; unannounced], [Selection (one or more): in-depth 
monitoring; vulnerability scanning; malicious user testing; insider threat assessment; 
performance/load testing; [Assignment: organization-defined other forms of security assessment]]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Organizations can employ information system monitoring, insider 
threat assessments, malicious user testing, and other forms of testing (e.g., verification and 
validation) to improve readiness by exercising organizational capabilities and indicating 
current performance levels as a means of focusing actions to improve security. Organizations 
conduct assessment activities in accordance with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, 
directives, policies, regulations, and standards. Authorizing officials approve the assessment 
methods in coordination with the organizational risk executive function. Organizations can 
incorporate vulnerabilities uncovered during assessments into vulnerability remediation 
processes. Related controls: PE-3, SI-2. 
(3) SECURITY ASSESSMENTS | EXTERNAL ORGANIZATIONS 
The organization accepts the results of an assessment of [Assignment: organization-defined 
information system] performed by [Assignment: organization-defined external organization] when 
the assessment meets [Assignment: organization-defined requirements]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Organizations may often rely on assessments of specific information 
systems by other (external) organizations. Utilizing such existing assessments (i.e., reusing 
existing assessment evidence) can significantly decrease the time and resources required for 
organizational assessments by limiting the amount of independent assessment activities that 
organizations need to perform. The factors that organizations may consider in determining 
whether to accept assessment results from external organizations can vary. Determinations for 
accepting assessment results can be based on, for example, past assessment experiences one 
organization has had with another organization, the reputation that organizations have with 
regard to assessments, the level of detail of supporting assessment documentation provided, or 
mandates imposed upon organizations by federal legislation, policies, or directives.

b. Documents, for each interconnection, the interface characteristics, security requirements, and 
the nature of the information communicated; and 
c. Reviews and updates Interconnection Security Agreements [Assignment: organization-defined 
frequency]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  This control applies to dedicated connections between information systems 
(i.e., system interconnections) and does not apply to transitory, user-controlled connections such 
as email and website browsing. Organizations carefully consider the risks that may be introduced 
when information systems are connected to other systems with different security requirements and 
security controls, both within organizations and external to organizations. Authorizing officials 
determine the risk associated with information system connections and the appropriate controls 
employed. If interconnecting systems have the same authorizing official, organizations do not 
need to develop Interconnection Security Agreements. Instead, organizations can describe the 
interface characteristics between those interconnecting systems in their respective security plans. 
If interconnecting systems have different authorizing officials within the same organization, 
organizations can either develop Interconnection Security Agreements or describe the interface 
characteristics between systems in the security plans for the respective systems. Organizations 
may also incorporate Interconnection Security Agreement information into formal contracts, 
especially for interconnections established between federal agencies and nonfederal (i.e., private 
sector) organizations. Risk considerations also include information systems sharing the same 
networks. For certain technologies (e.g., space, unmanned aerial vehicles, and medical devices), 
there may be specialized connections in place during preoperational testing. Such connections may 
require Interconnection Security Agreements and be subject to additional security controls.

Supplemental Guidance:  Organizations typically do not have control over external networks 
(e.g., the Internet). Approved boundary protection devices (e.g., routers, firewalls) mediate 
communications (i.e., information flows) between classified national security systems and 
external networks. In addition, approved boundary protection devices (typically managed

CA-6 SECURITY AUTHORIZATION 
Control:  The organization: 
a. Assigns a senior-level executive or manager as the authorizing official for the information 
system; 
b. Ensures that the authorizing official authorizes the information system for processing before 
commencing operations; and 
c. Updates the security authorization [Assignment: organization-defined frequency]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Security authorizations are official management decisions, conveyed 
through authorization decision documents, by senior organizational officials or executives (i.e., 
authorizing officials) to authorize operation of information systems and to explicitly accept the 
risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation based 
on the implementation of agreed-upon security controls. Authorizing officials provide budgetary 
oversight for organizational information systems or assume responsibility for the mission/business 
operations supported by those systems. The security authorization process is an inherently federal 
responsibility and therefore, authorizing officials must be federal employees. Through the security 
authorization process, authorizing officials assume responsibility and are accountable for security 
risks associated with the operation and use of organizational information systems. Accordingly, 
authorizing officials are in positions with levels of authority commensurate with understanding 
and accepting such information security-related risks. OMB policy requires that organizations 
conduct ongoing authorizations of information systems by implementing continuous monitoring 
programs. Continuous monitoring programs can satisfy three-year reauthorization requirements, so 
separate reauthorization processes are not necessary. Through the employment of comprehensive 
continuous monitoring processes, critical information contained in authorization packages (i.e., 
security plans, security assessment reports, and plans of action and milestones) is updated on an 
ongoing basis, providing authorizing officials and information system owners with an up-to-date 
status of the security state of organizational information systems and environments of operation.  
To reduce the administrative cost of security reauthorization, authorizing officials use the results 
of continuous monitoring processes to the maximum extent possible as the basis for rendering 
reauthorization decisions. Related controls: CA-2, CA-7, PM-9, PM-10.

CA-7 CONTINUOUS MONITORING 
 Control:  The organization develops a continuous monitoring strategy and implements a continuous 
monitoring program that includes: 
a. Establishment of [Assignment: organization-defined metrics] to be monitored; 
b. Establishment of [Assignment: organization-defined frequencies] for monitoring and 
[Assignment: organization-defined frequencies] for assessments supporting such monitoring; 
c. Ongoing security control assessments in accordance with the organizational continuous 
monitoring strategy; 
d. Ongoing security status monitoring of organization-defined metrics in accordance with the 
organizational continuous monitoring strategy;

e. Correlation and analysis of security-related information generated by assessments and 
monitoring; 
f. Response actions to address results of the analysis of security-related information; and 
g. Reporting the security status of organization and the information system to [Assignment: 
organization-defined personnel or roles] [Assignment: organization-defined frequency]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Continuous monitoring programs facilitate ongoing awareness of threats, 
vulnerabilities, and information security to support organizational risk management decisions. The 
terms continuous and ongoing imply that organizations assess/analyze security controls and 
information security-related risks at a frequency sufficient to support organizational risk-based 
decisions. The results of continuous monitoring programs generate appropriate risk response 
actions by organizations. Continuous monitoring programs also allow organizations to maintain 
the security authorizations of information systems and common controls over time in highly 
dynamic environments of operation with changing mission/business needs, threats, vulnerabilities, 
and technologies. Having access to security-related information on a continuing basis through 
reports/dashboards gives organizational officials the capability to make more effective and timely 
risk management decisions, including ongoing security authorization decisions. Automation 
supports more frequent updates to security authorization packages, hardware/software/firmware 
inventories, and other system information. Effectiveness is further enhanced when continuous 
monitoring outputs are formatted to provide information that is specific, measurable, actionable, 
relevant, and timely. Continuous monitoring activities are scaled in accordance with the security 
categories of information systems. Related controls: CA-2, CA-5, CA-6, CM-3, CM-4, PM-6, PM-
9, RA-5, SA-11, SA-12, SI-2, SI-4. 
Control Enhancements: 
(1) CONTINUOUS MONITORING | INDEPENDENT ASSESSMENT  
The organization employs assessors or assessment teams with [Assignment: organization-defined 
level of independence] to monitor the security controls in the information system on an ongoing 
basis. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Organizations can maximize the value of assessments of security 
controls during the continuous monitoring process by requiring that such assessments be 
conducted by assessors or assessment teams with appropriate levels of independence based on 
continuous monitoring strategies. Assessor independence provides a degree of impartiality to 
the monitoring process. To achieve such impartiality, assessors should not: (i) create a mutual 
or conflicting interest with the organizations where the assessments are being conducted; (ii) 
assess their own work; (iii) act as management or employees of the organizations they are 
serving; or (iv) place themselves in advocacy positions for the organizations acquiring their 
services. 
(2) CONTINUOUS MONITORING | TYPES OF ASSESSMENTS  
[Withdrawn: Incorporated into CA-2.] 
(3) CONTINUOUS MONITORING | TREND ANALYSES  
The organization employs trend analyses to determine if security control implementations, the 
frequency of continuous monitoring activities, and/or the types of activities used in the continuous 
monitoring process need to be modified based on empirical data. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Trend analyses can include, for example, examining recent threat 
information regarding the types of threat events that have occurred within the organization or 
across the federal government, success rates of certain types of cyber attacks, emerging 
vulnerabilities in information technologies, evolving social engineering techniques, results 
from multiple security control assessments, the effectiveness of configuration settings, and 
findings from Inspectors General or auditors.

CA-8 PENETRATION TESTING 
 Control:  The organization conducts penetration testing [Assignment: organization-defined 
frequency] on [Assignment: organization-defined information systems or system components]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Penetration testing is a specialized type of assessment conducted on 
information systems or individual system components to identify vulnerabilities that could be 
exploited by adversaries. Such testing can be used to either validate vulnerabilities or determine 
the degree of resistance organizational information systems have to adversaries within a set of 
specified constraints (e.g., time, resources, and/or skills). Penetration testing attempts to duplicate 
the actions of adversaries in carrying out hostile cyber attacks against organizations and provides a 
more in-depth analysis of security-related weaknesses/deficiencies. Organizations can also use the 
results of vulnerability analyses to support penetration testing activities. Penetration testing can be 
conducted on the hardware, software, or firmware components of an information system and can 
exercise both physical and technical security controls. A standard method for penetration testing 
includes, for example: (i) pretest analysis based on full knowledge of the target system; (ii) pretest 
identification of potential vulnerabilities based on pretest analysis; and (iii) testing designed to 
determine exploitability of identified vulnerabilities. All parties agree to the rules of engagement 
before the commencement of penetration testing scenarios. Organizations correlate the penetration 
testing rules of engagement with the tools, techniques, and procedures that are anticipated to be 
employed by adversaries carrying out attacks. Organizational risk assessments guide decisions on 
the level of independence required for personnel conducting penetration testing. Related control: 
SA-12. 
Control Enhancements: 
(1) PENETRATION TESTING | INDEPENDENT PENETRATION AGENT OR TEAM  
The organization employs an independent penetration agent or penetration team to perform 
penetration testing on the information system or system components. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Independent penetration agents or teams are individuals or groups who 
conduct impartial penetration testing of organizational information systems. Impartiality 
implies that penetration agents or teams are free from any perceived or actual conflicts of 
interest with regard to the development, operation, or management of the information systems 
that are the targets of the penetration testing. Supplemental guidance for CA-2 (1) provides 
additional information regarding independent assessments that can be applied to penetration 
testing. Related control: CA-2. 
(2) PENETRATION TESTING | RED TEAM EXERCISES  
The organization employs [Assignment: organization-defined red team exercises] to simulate 
attempts by adversaries to compromise organizational information systems in accordance with 
[Assignment: organization-defined rules of engagement]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Red team exercises extend the objectives of penetration testing by 
examining the security posture of organizations and their ability to implement effective cyber 
defenses. As such, red team exercises reflect simulated adversarial attempts to compromise 
organizational mission/business functions and provide a comprehensive assessment of the 
security state of information systems and organizations. Simulated adversarial attempts to 
compromise organizational missions/business functions and the information systems that 
support those missions/functions may include technology-focused attacks (e.g., interactions 
with hardware, software, or firmware components and/or mission/business processes) and 
social engineering-based attacks (e.g., interactions via email, telephone, shoulder surfing, or 
personal conversations). While penetration testing may be largely laboratory-based testing, 
organizations use red team exercises to provide more comprehensive assessments that reflect

b. Documents, for each internal connection, the interface characteristics, security requirements, 
and the nature of the information communicated. 
Supplemental Guidance:  This control applies to connections between organizational information 
systems and (separate) constituent system components (i.e., intra-system connections) including, 
for example, system connections with mobile devices, notebook/desktop computers, printers, 
copiers, facsimile machines, scanners, sensors, and servers. Instead of authorizing each individual 
internal connection, organizations can authorize internal connections for a class of components 
with common characteristics and/or configurations, for example, all digital printers, scanners, and 
copiers with a specified processing, storage, and transmission capability or all smart phones with a 
specific baseline configuration. Related controls: AC-3, AC-4, AC-18, AC-19, AU-2, AU-12, CA-

1. A configuration management policy that addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, 
management commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and compliance; 
and 
2. Procedures to facilitate the implementation of the configuration management policy and 
associated configuration management controls; and 
b. Reviews and updates the current: 
1. Configuration management policy [Assignment: organization-defined frequency]; and 
2. Configuration management procedures [Assignment: organization-defined frequency]. 
Supplemental Guidance: This control addresses the establishment of policy and procedures for the 
effective implementation of selected security controls and control enhancements in the CM family. 
Policy and procedures reflect applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, 
policies, standards, and guidance. Security program policies and procedures at the organization 
level may make the need for system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The policy can 
be included as part of the general information security policy for organizations or conversely, can 
be represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex nature of certain organizations. The 
procedures can be established for the security program in general and for particular information 
systems, if needed. The organizational risk management strategy is a key factor in establishing 
policy and procedures. Related control: PM-9.

CM-2 BASELINE CONFIGURATION 
 Control:  The organization develops, documents, and maintains under configuration control, a 
current baseline configuration of the information system. 
Supplemental Guidance:  This control establishes baseline configurations for information systems 
and system components including communications and connectivity-related aspects of systems. 
Baseline configurations are documented, formally reviewed and agreed-upon sets of specifications 
for information systems or configuration items within those systems. Baseline configurations 
serve as a basis for future builds, releases, and/or changes to information systems. Baseline 
configurations include information about information system components (e.g., standard software 
packages installed on workstations, notebook computers, servers, network components, or mobile 
devices; current version numbers and patch information on operating systems and applications; 
and configuration settings/parameters), network topology, and the logical placement of those 
components within the system architecture. Maintaining baseline configurations requires creating 
new baselines as organizational information systems change over time. Baseline configurations of 
information systems reflect the current enterprise architecture. Related controls: CM-3, CM-6, 
CM-8, CM-9, SA-10, PM-5, PM-7.

Control Enhancements: 
(1) BASELINE CONFIGURATION | REVIEWS AND UPDATES  
The organization reviews and updates the baseline configuration of the information system: 
(a) [Assignment: organization-defined frequency]; 
(b) When required due to [Assignment organization-defined circumstances]; and 
(c) As an integral part of information system component installations and upgrades. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Related control: CM-5. 
(2) BASELINE CONFIGURATION | AUTOMATION SUPPORT FOR ACCURACY / CURRENCY  
The organization employs automated mechanisms to maintain an up-to-date, complete, accurate, 
and readily available baseline configuration of the information system. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Automated mechanisms that help organizations maintain consistent 
baseline configurations for information systems include, for example, hardware and software 
inventory tools, configuration management tools, and network management tools. Such tools 
can be deployed and/or allocated as common controls, at the information system level, or at 
the operating system or component level (e.g., on workstations, servers, notebook computers, 
network components, or mobile devices). Tools can be used, for example, to track version 
numbers on operating system applications, types of software installed, and current patch 
levels. This control enhancement can be satisfied by the implementation of CM-8 (2) for 
organizations that choose to combine information system component inventory and baseline 
configuration activities. Related controls: CM-7, RA-5. 
(3) BASELINE CONFIGURATION | RETENTION OF PREVIOUS CONFIGURATIONS 
The organization retains [Assignment: organization-defined previous versions of baseline 
configurations of the information system] to support rollback. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Retaining previous versions of baseline configurations to support 
rollback may include, for example, hardware, software, firmware, configuration files, and 
configuration records. 
(4) BASELINE CONFIGURATION | UNAUTHORIZED SOFTWARE  
[Withdrawn: Incorporated into CM-7]. 
(5) BASELINE CONFIGURATION | AUTHORIZED SOFTWARE  
[Withdrawn: Incorporated into CM-7]. 
(6) BASELINE CONFIGURATION | DEVELOPMENT AND TEST ENVIRONMENTS  
The organization maintains a baseline configuration for information system development and test 
environments that is managed separately from the operational baseline configuration. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Establishing separate baseline configurations for development, testing, 
and operational environments helps protect information systems from unplanned/unexpected 
events related to development and testing activities. Separate baseline configurations allow 
organizations to apply the configuration management that is most appropriate for each type of 
configuration. For example, management of operational configurations typically emphasizes 
the need for stability, while management of development/test configurations requires greater 
flexibility. Configurations in the test environment mirror the configurations in the operational 
environment to the extent practicable so that the results of the testing are representative of the 
proposed changes to the operational systems. This control enhancement requires separate 
configurations but not necessarily separate physical environments. Related controls: CM-4, 
SC-3, SC-7. 
(7) BASELINE CONFIGURATION | CONFIGURE SYSTEMS, COMPONENTS, OR DEVICES FOR HIGH-RISK AREAS  
The organization: 
(a) Issues [Assignment: organization-defined information systems, system components, or 
devices] with [Assignment: organization-defined configurations] to individuals traveling to 
locations that the organization deems to be of significant risk; and 
(b) Applies [Assignment: organization-defined security safeguards] to the devices when the 
individuals return.

Supplemental Guidance:  When it is known that information systems, system components, or 
devices (e.g., notebook computers, mobile devices) will be located in high-risk areas, 
additional security controls may be implemented to counter the greater threat in such areas 
coupled with the lack of physical security relative to organizational-controlled areas. For 
example, organizational policies and procedures for notebook computers used by individuals 
departing on and returning from travel include, for example, determining which locations are 
of concern, defining required configurations for the devices, ensuring that the devices are 
configured as intended before travel is initiated, and applying specific safeguards to the 
device after travel is completed. Specially configured notebook computers include, for 
example, computers with sanitized hard drives, limited applications, and additional hardening 
(e.g., more stringent configuration settings). Specified safeguards applied to mobile devices 
upon return from travel include, for example, examining the device for signs of physical 
tampering and purging/reimaging the hard disk drive. Protecting information residing on 
mobile devices is covered in the media protection family..

CM-3 CONFIGURATION CHANGE CONTROL 
 Control:  The organization: 
a. Determines the types of changes to the information system that are configuration-controlled; 
b. Reviews proposed configuration-controlled changes to the information system and approves 
or disapproves such changes with explicit consideration for security impact analyses; 
c. Documents configuration change decisions associated with the information system; 
d. Implements approved configuration-controlled changes to the information system; 
e. Retains records of configuration-controlled changes to the information system for 
[Assignment: organization-defined time period]; 
f. Audits and reviews activities associated with configuration-controlled changes to the 
information system; and 
g. Coordinates and provides oversight for configuration change control activities through 
[Assignment: organization-defined configuration change control element (e.g., committee, 
board] that convenes [Selection (one or more): [Assignment: organization-defined frequency]; 
[Assignment: organization-defined configuration change conditions]]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Configuration change controls for organizational information systems 
involve the systematic proposal, justification, implementation, testing, review, and disposition of 
changes to the systems, including system upgrades and modifications. Configuration change 
control includes changes to baseline configurations for components and configuration items of 
information systems, changes to configuration settings for information technology products (e.g., 
operating systems, applications, firewalls, routers, and mobile devices), unscheduled/unauthorized 
changes, and changes to remediate vulnerabilities. Typical processes for managing configuration 
changes to information systems include, for example, Configuration Control Boards that approve 
proposed changes to systems. For new development information systems or systems undergoing 
major upgrades, organizations consider including representatives from development organizations 
on the Configuration Control Boards. Auditing of changes includes activities before and after 
changes are made to organizational information systems and the auditing activities required to 
implement such changes. Related controls: CM-2, CM-4, CM-5, CM-6, CM-9, SA-10, SI-2, SI-

APPENDIX F-CM   PAGE F-67 
Control Enhancements: 
(1) CONFIGURATION CHANGE CONTROL | AUTOMATED DOCUMENT / NOTIFICATION / PROHIBITION OF CHANGES 
The organization employs automated mechanisms to: 
(a) Document proposed changes to the information system; 
(b) Notify [Assignment: organized-defined approval authorities] of proposed changes to the 
information system and request change approval; 
(c) Highlight proposed changes to the information system that have not been approved or 
disapproved by [Assignment: organization-defined time period]; 
(d) Prohibit changes to the information system until designated approvals are received; 
(e) Document all changes to the information system; and 
(f) Notify [Assignment: organization-defined personnel] when approved changes to the 
information system are completed. 
(2) CONFIGURATION CHANGE CONTROL | TEST / VALIDATE / DOCUMENT CHANGES  
The organization tests, validates, and documents changes to the information system before 
implementing the changes on the operational system. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Changes to information systems include modifications to hardware, 
software, or firmware components and configuration settings defined in CM-6. Organizations 
ensure that testing does not interfere with information system operations. Individuals/groups 
conducting tests understand organizational security policies and procedures, information 
system security policies and procedures, and the specific health, safety, and environmental 
risks associated with particular facilities/processes. Operational systems may need to be taken 
off-line, or replicated to the extent feasible, before testing can be conducted. If information 
systems must be taken off-line for testing, the tests are scheduled to occur during planned 
system outages whenever possible. If testing cannot be conducted on operational systems, 
organizations employ compensating controls (e.g., testing on replicated systems). 
(3) CONFIGURATION CHANGE CONTROL | AUTOMATED CHANGE IMPLEMENTATION 
The organization employs automated mechanisms to implement changes to the current 
information system baseline and deploys the updated baseline across the installed base. 
(4) CONFIGURATION CHANGE CONTROL | SECURITY REPRESENTATIVE  
The organization requires an information security representative to be a member of the 
[Assignment: organization-defined configuration change control element]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Information security representatives can include, for example, senior 
agency information security officers, information system security officers, or information 
system security managers. Representation by personnel with information security expertise is 
important because changes to information system configurations can have unintended side 
effects, some of which may be security-relevant. Detecting such changes early in the process 
can help avoid unintended, negative consequences that could ultimately affect the security 
state of organizational information systems. The configuration change control element in this 
control enhancement reflects the change control elements defined by organizations in CM-3. 
(5) CONFIGURATION CHANGE CONTROL | AUTOMATED SECURITY RESPONSE  
The information system implements [Assignment: organization-defined security responses] 
automatically if baseline configurations are changed in an unauthorized manner. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Security responses include, for example, halting information system 
processing, halting selected system functions, or issuing alerts/notifications to organizational 
personnel when there is an unauthorized modification of a configuration item. 
(6) CONFIGURATION CHANGE CONTROL | CRYPTOGRAPHY MANAGEMENT  
The organization ensures that cryptographic mechanisms used to provide [Assignment: 
organization-defined security safeguards] are under configuration management. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Regardless of the cryptographic means employed (e.g., public key, 
private key, shared secrets), organizations ensure that there are processes and procedures in 
place to effectively manage those means. For example, if devices use certificates as a basis for

CM-4 SECURITY IMPACT ANALYSIS 
Control:  The organization analyzes changes to the information system to determine potential 
security impacts prior to change implementation. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Organizational personnel with information security responsibilities (e.g., 
Information System Administrators, Information System Security Officers, Information System 
Security Managers, and Information System Security Engineers) conduct security impact analyses. 
Individuals conducting security impact analyses possess the necessary skills/technical expertise to 
analyze the changes to information systems and the associated security ramifications. Security 
impact analysis may include, for example, reviewing security plans to understand security control 
requirements and reviewing system design documentation to understand control implementation 
and how specific changes might affect the controls. Security impact analyses may also include 
assessments of risk to better understand the impact of the changes and to determine if additional 
security controls are required. Security impact analyses are scaled in accordance with the security 
categories of the information systems. Related controls: CA-2, CA-7, CM-3, CM-9, SA-4, SA-5, 
SA-10, SI-2. 
Control Enhancements: 
(1) SECURITY IMPACT ANALYSIS | SEPARATE TEST ENVIRONMENTS  
The organization analyzes changes to the information system in a separate test environment 
before implementation in an operational environment, looking for security impacts due to flaws, 
weaknesses, incompatibility, or intentional malice. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Separate test environment in this context means an environment that is 
physically or logically isolated and distinct from the operational environment. The separation 
is sufficient to ensure that activities in the test environment do not impact activities in the 
operational environment, and information in the operational environment is not inadvertently 
transmitted to the test environment. Separate environments can be achieved by physical or 
logical means. If physically separate test environments are not used, organizations determine 
the strength of mechanism required when implementing logical separation (e.g., separation 
achieved through virtual machines). Related controls: SA-11, SC-3, SC-7. 
(2) SECURITY IMPACT ANALYSIS | VERIFICATION OF SECURITY FUNCTIONS  
The organization, after the information system is changed, checks the security functions to verify 
that the functions are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired 
outcome with regard to meeting the security requirements for the system. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Implementation is this context refers to installing changed code in the 
operational information system. Related control: SA-11.

CM-5 ACCESS RESTRICTIONS FOR CHANGE 
Control:  The organization defines, documents, approves, and enforces physical and logical access 
restrictions associated with changes to the information system.  
Supplemental Guidance:  Any changes to the hardware, software, and/or firmware components of 
information systems can potentially have significant effects on the overall security of the systems. 
Therefore, organizations permit only qualified and authorized individuals to access information 
systems for purposes of initiating changes, including upgrades and modifications. Organizations 
maintain records of access to ensure that configuration change control is implemented and to 
support after-the-fact actions should organizations discover any unauthorized changes. Access 
restrictions for change also include software libraries. Access restrictions include, for example, 
physical and logical access controls (see AC-3 and PE-3), workflow automation, media libraries, 
abstract layers (e.g., changes implemented into third-party interfaces rather than directly into 
information systems), and change windows (e.g., changes occur only during specified times, 
making unauthorized changes easy to discover). Related controls: AC-3, AC-6, PE-3. 
Control Enhancements: 
(1) ACCESS RESTRICTIONS FOR CHANGE | AUTOMATED ACCESS ENFORCEMENT / AUDITING 
The information system enforces access restrictions and supports auditing of the enforcement 
actions. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Related controls: AU-2, AU-12, AU-6, CM-3, CM-6. 
(2) ACCESS RESTRICTIONS FOR CHANGE | REVIEW SYSTEM CHANGES 
The organization reviews information system changes [Assignment: organization-defined 
frequency] and [Assignment: organization-defined circumstances] to determine whether 
unauthorized changes have occurred. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Indications that warrant review of information system changes and the 
specific circumstances justifying such reviews may be obtained from activities carried out by 
organizations during the configuration change process. Related controls: AU-6, AU-7, CM-3, 
CM-5, PE-6, PE-8. 
(3) ACCESS RESTRICTIONS FOR CHANGE | SIGNED COMPONENTS  
The information system prevents the installation of [Assignment: organization-defined software 
and firmware components] without verification that the component has been digitally signed using 
a certificate that is recognized and approved by the organization. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Software and firmware components prevented from installation unless 
signed with recognized and approved certificates include, for example, software and firmware 
version updates, patches, service packs, device drivers, and basic input output system (BIOS) 
updates. Organizations can identify applicable software and firmware components by type, by 
specific items, or a combination of both. Digital signatures and organizational verification of 
such signatures, is a method of code authentication. Related controls: CM-7, SC-13, SI-7. 
(4) ACCESS RESTRICTIONS FOR CHANGE | DUAL AUTHORIZATION  
The organization enforces dual authorization for implementing changes to [Assignment: 
organization-defined information system components and system-level information]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Organizations employ dual authorization to ensure that any changes to 
selected information system components and information cannot occur unless two qualified 
individuals implement such changes. The two individuals possess sufficient skills/expertise to 
determine if the proposed changes are correct implementations of approved changes. Related 
controls: AC-5, CM-3. 
(5) ACCESS RESTRICTIONS FOR CHANGE | LIMIT PRODUCTION / OPERATIONAL PRIVILEGES 
The organization: 
(a) Limits privileges to change information system components and system-related information 
within a production or operational environment; and 
(b) Reviews and reevaluates privileges [Assignment: organization-defined frequency]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  In many organizations, information systems support multiple core 
missions/business functions. Limiting privileges to change information system components 
with respect to operational systems is necessary because changes to a particular information

CM-6 CONFIGURATION SETTINGS 
 Control:  The organization: 
a. Establishes and documents configuration settings for information technology products 
employed within the information system using [Assignment: organization-defined security 
configuration checklists] that reflect the most restrictive mode consistent with operational 
requirements; 
b. Implements the configuration settings; 
c. Identifies, documents, and approves any deviations from established configuration settings for 
[Assignment: organization-defined information system components] based on [Assignment: 
organization-defined operational requirements]; and 
d. Monitors and controls changes to the configuration settings in accordance with organizational 
policies and procedures. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Configuration settings are the set of parameters that can be changed in 
hardware, software, or firmware components of the information system that affect the security 
posture and/or functionality of the system. Information technology products for which security-
related configuration settings can be defined include, for example, mainframe computers, servers 
(e.g., database, electronic mail, authentication, web, proxy, file, domain name), workstations, 
input/output devices (e.g.,  scanners, copiers, and printers), network components (e.g., firewalls, 
routers, gateways, voice and data switches, wireless access points, network appliances, sensors), 
operating systems, middleware, and applications. Security-related parameters are those parameters 
impacting the security state of information systems including the parameters required to satisfy 
other security control requirements. Security-related parameters include, for example: (i) registry 
settings; (ii) account, file, directory permission settings; and (iii) settings for functions, ports, 
protocols, services, and remote connections. Organizations establish organization-wide 
configuration settings and subsequently derive specific settings for information systems. The 
established settings become part of the systems configuration baseline. 
Common secure configurations (also referred to as security configuration checklists, lockdown 
and hardening guides, security reference guides, security technical implementation guides) provide 
recognized, standardized, and established benchmarks that stipulate secure configuration settings 
for specific information technology platforms/products and instructions for configuring those 
information system components to meet operational requirements. Common secure configurations 
can be developed by a variety of organizations including, for example, information technology 
product developers, manufacturers, vendors, consortia, academia, industry, federal agencies, and 
other organizations in the public and private sectors. Common secure configurations include the

CM-6 and other controls such as AC-19 and CM-7. The Security Content Automation Protocol 
(SCAP) and the defined standards within the protocol (e.g., Common Configuration Enumeration) 
provide an effective method to uniquely identify, track, and control configuration settings. OMB

CM-7 LEAST FUNCTIONALITY 
 Control:  The organization: 
a. Configures the information system to provide only essential capabilities; and 
b. Prohibits or restricts the use of the following functions, ports, protocols, and/or services: 
[Assignment: organization-defined prohibited or restricted functions, ports, protocols, and/or 
services]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Information systems can provide a wide variety of functions and services. 
Some of the functions and services, provided by default, may not be necessary to support essential 
organizational operations (e.g., key missions, functions). Additionally, it is sometimes convenient 
to provide multiple services from single information system components, but doing so increases 
risk over limiting the services provided by any one component. Where feasible, organizations limit 
component functionality to a single function per device (e.g., email servers or web servers, but not 
both). Organizations review functions and services provided by information systems or individual 
components of information systems, to determine which functions and services are candidates for 
elimination (e.g., Voice Over Internet Protocol, Instant Messaging, auto-execute, and file sharing). 
Organizations consider disabling unused or unnecessary physical and logical ports/protocols (e.g., 
Universal Serial Bus, File Transfer Protocol, and Hyper Text Transfer Protocol) on information 
systems to prevent unauthorized connection of devices, unauthorized transfer of information, or 
unauthorized tunneling. Organizations can utilize network scanning tools, intrusion detection and 
prevention systems, and end-point protections such as firewalls and host-based intrusion detection

systems to identify and prevent the use of prohibited functions, ports, protocols, and services. 
Related controls: AC-6, CM-2, RA-5, SA-5, SC-7. 
Control Enhancements: 
(1) LEAST FUNCTIONALITY | PERIODIC REVIEW  
The organization: 
(a) Reviews the information system [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] to identify 
unnecessary and/or nonsecure functions, ports, protocols, and services; and 
(b) Disables [Assignment: organization-defined functions, ports, protocols, and services within 
the information system deemed to be unnecessary and/or nonsecure]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  The organization can either make a determination of the relative 
security of the function, port, protocol, and/or service or base the security decision on the 
assessment of other entities. Bluetooth, FTP, and peer-to-peer networking are examples of 
less than secure protocols. Related controls: AC-18, CM-7, IA-2. 
(2) LEAST FUNCTIONALITY | PREVENT PROGRAM EXECUTION  
The information system prevents program execution in accordance with [Selection (one or more): 
[Assignment: organization-defined policies regarding software program usage and restrictions]; 
rules authorizing the terms and conditions of software program usage]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Related controls: CM-8, PM-5. 
(3) LEAST FUNCTIONALITY | REGISTRATION COMPLIANCE  
The organization ensures compliance with [Assignment: organization-defined registration 
requirements for functions, ports, protocols, and services]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Organizations use the registration process to manage, track, and 
provide oversight for information systems and implemented functions, ports, protocols, and 
services. 
(4) LEAST FUNCTIONALITY | UNAUTHORIZED SOFTWARE / BLACKLISTING 
The organization: 
(a) Identifies [Assignment: organization-defined software programs not authorized to execute on 
the information system]; 
(b) Employs an allow-all, deny-by-exception policy to prohibit the execution of unauthorized 
software programs on the information system; and 
(c) Reviews and updates the list of unauthorized software programs [Assignment: organization-
defined frequency]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  The process used to identify software programs that are not authorized 
to execute on organizational information systems is commonly referred to as blacklisting. 
Organizations can implement CM-7 (5) instead of this control enhancement if whitelisting 
(the stronger of the two policies) is the preferred approach for restricting software program 
execution. Related controls: CM-6, CM-8, PM-5. 
(5) LEAST FUNCTIONALITY | AUTHORIZED SOFTWARE / WHITELISTING 
The organization: 
(a) Identifies [Assignment: organization-defined software programs authorized to execute on the 
information system]; 
(b) Employs a deny-all, permit-by-exception policy to allow the execution of authorized software 
programs on the information system; and 
(c) Reviews and updates the list of authorized software programs [Assignment: organization-
defined frequency]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  The process used to identify software programs that are authorized to 
execute on organizational information systems is commonly referred to as whitelisting. In 
addition to whitelisting, organizations consider verifying the integrity of white-listed software 
programs using, for example, cryptographic checksums, digital signatures, or hash functions. 
Verification of white-listed software can occur either prior to execution or at system startup.

CM-8 INFORMATION SYSTEM COMPONENT INVENTORY 
 Control:  The organization: 
a. Develops and documents an inventory of information system components that: 
1. Accurately reflects the current information system; 
2. Includes all components within the authorization boundary of the information system; 
3. Is at the level of granularity deemed necessary for tracking and reporting; and 
4. Includes [Assignment: organization-defined information deemed necessary to achieve 
effective information system component accountability]; and 
b. Reviews and updates the information system component inventory [Assignment: 
organization-defined frequency]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Organizations may choose to implement centralized information system 
component inventories that include components from all organizational information systems. In 
such situations, organizations ensure that the resulting inventories include system-specific 
information required for proper component accountability (e.g., information system association, 
information system owner). Information deemed necessary for effective accountability of 
information system components includes, for example, hardware inventory specifications, 
software license information, software version numbers, component owners, and for networked 
components or devices, machine names and network addresses. Inventory specifications include, 
for example, manufacturer, device type, model, serial number, and physical location. Related 
controls: CM-2, CM-6, PM-5. 
Control Enhancements: 
(1) INFORMATION SYSTEM COMPONENT INVENTORY | UPDATES DURING INSTALLATIONS / REMOVALS  
The organization updates the inventory of information system components as an integral part of 
component installations, removals, and information system updates. 
(2) INFORMATION SYSTEM COMPONENT INVENTORY | AUTOMATED MAINTENANCE  
The organization employs automated mechanisms to help maintain an up-to-date, complete, 
accurate, and readily available inventory of information system components. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Organizations maintain information system inventories to the extent 
feasible. Virtual machines, for example, can be difficult to monitor because such machines are 
not visible to the network when not in use. In such cases, organizations maintain as up-to-
date, complete, and accurate an inventory as is deemed reasonable. This control enhancement 
can be satisfied by the implementation of CM-2 (2) for organizations that choose to combine 
information system component inventory and baseline configuration activities. Related 
control: SI-7. 
(3) INFORMATION SYSTEM COMPONENT INVENTORY | AUTOMATED UNAUTHORIZED COMPONENT DETECTION 
The organization: 
(a) Employs automated mechanisms [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] to detect the 
presence of unauthorized hardware, software, and firmware components within the 
information system; and 
(b) Takes the following actions when unauthorized components are detected: [Selection (one or 
more): disables network access by such components; isolates the components; notifies 
[Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles]].

APPENDIX F-CM   PAGE F-74 
Supplemental Guidance:  This control enhancement is applied in addition to the monitoring for 
unauthorized remote connections and mobile devices. Monitoring for unauthorized system 
components may be accomplished on an ongoing basis or by the periodic scanning of systems 
for that purpose. Automated mechanisms can be implemented within information systems or 
in other separate devices. Isolation can be achieved, for example, by placing unauthorized 
information system components in separate domains or subnets or otherwise quarantining 
such components. This type of component isolation is commonly referred to as sandboxing. 
Related controls: AC-17, AC-18, AC-19, CA-7, SI-3, SI-4, SI-7, RA-5. 
(4) INFORMATION SYSTEM COMPONENT INVENTORY | ACCOUNTABILITY INFORMATION  
The organization includes in the information system component inventory information, a means for 
identifying by [Selection (one or more): name; position; role], individuals responsible/accountable 
for administering those components. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Identifying individuals who are both responsible and accountable for 
administering information system components helps to ensure that the assigned components 
are properly administered and organizations can contact those individuals if some action is 
required (e.g., component is determined to be the source of a breach/compromise, component 
needs to be recalled/replaced, or component needs to be relocated). 
(5) INFORMATION SYSTEM COMPONENT INVENTORY | NO DUPLICATE ACCOUNTING OF COMPONENTS 
The organization verifies that all components within the authorization boundary of the information 
system are not duplicated in other information system inventories. 
Supplemental Guidance:  This control enhancement addresses the potential problem of duplicate 
accounting of information system components in large or complex interconnected systems. 
(6) INFORMATION SYSTEM COMPONENT INVENTORY | ASSESSED CONFIGURATIONS / APPROVED DEVIATIONS  
The organization includes assessed component configurations and any approved deviations to 
current deployed configurations in the information system component inventory. 
Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement focuses on configuration settings established 
by organizations for information system components, the specific components that have been 
assessed to determine compliance with the required configuration settings, and any approved 
deviations from established configuration settings. Related controls: CM-2, CM-6. 
(7) INFORMATION SYSTEM COMPONENT INVENTORY | CENTRALIZED REPOSITORY  
The organization provides a centralized repository for the inventory of information system 
components. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Organizations may choose to implement centralized information 
system component inventories that include components from all organizational information 
systems. Centralized repositories of information system component inventories provide 
opportunities for efficiencies in accounting for organizational hardware, software, and 
firmware assets. Such repositories may also help organizations rapidly identify the location 
and responsible individuals of system components that have been compromised, breached, or 
are otherwise in need of mitigation actions. Organizations ensure that the resulting centralized 
inventories include system-specific information required for proper component accountability 
(e.g., information system association, information system owner). 
(8) INFORMATION SYSTEM COMPONENT INVENTORY | AUTOMATED LOCATION TRACKING  
The organization employs automated mechanisms to support tracking of information system 
components by geographic location. 
Supplemental Guidance:  The use of automated mechanisms to track the location of information 
system components can increase the accuracy of component inventories. Such capability may 
also help organizations rapidly identify the location and responsible individuals of system 
components that have been compromised, breached, or are otherwise in need of mitigation 
actions. 
(9) INFORMATION SYSTEM COMPONENT INVENTORY | ASSIGNMENT OF COMPONENTS TO SYSTEMS  
The organization: 
(a) Assigns [Assignment: organization-defined acquired information system components] to an 
information system; and

CM-9 CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT PLAN 
 Control:  The organization develops, documents, and implements a configuration management plan 
for the information system that: 
a. Addresses roles, responsibilities, and configuration management processes and procedures; 
b. Establishes a process for identifying configuration items throughout the system development 
life cycle and for managing the configuration of the configuration items; 
c. Defines the configuration items for the information system and places the configuration items 
under configuration management; and 
d. Protects the configuration management plan from unauthorized disclosure and modification.  
Supplemental Guidance:  Configuration management plans satisfy the requirements in configuration 
management policies while being tailored to individual information systems. Such plans define 
detailed processes and procedures for how configuration management is used to support system 
development life cycle activities at the information system level. Configuration management plans 
are typically developed during the development/acquisition phase of the system development life 
cycle. The plans describe how to move changes through change management processes, how to 
update configuration settings and baselines, how to maintain information system component 
inventories, how to control development, test, and operational environments, and how to develop, 
release, and update key documents. Organizations can employ templates to help ensure consistent 
and timely development and implementation of configuration management plans. Such templates 
can represent a master configuration management plan for the organization at large with subsets of 
the plan implemented on a system by system basis. Configuration management approval processes 
include designation of key management stakeholders responsible for reviewing and approving 
proposed changes to information systems, and personnel that conduct security impact analyses 
prior to the implementation of changes to the systems. Configuration items are the information 
system items (hardware, software, firmware, and documentation) to be configuration-managed. As 
information systems continue through the system development life cycle, new configuration items 
may be identified and some existing configuration items may no longer need to be under 
configuration control. Related controls: CM-2, CM-3, CM-4, CM-5, CM-8, SA-10. 
Control Enhancements: 
(1) CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT PLAN | ASSIGNMENT OF RESPONSIBILITY  
The organization assigns responsibility for developing the configuration management process to 
organizational personnel that are not directly involved in information system development. 
Supplemental Guidance: In the absence of dedicated configuration management teams assigned 
within organizations, system developers may be tasked to develop configuration management 
processes using personnel who are not directly involved in system development or integration. 
This separation of duties ensures that organizations establish and maintain a sufficient degree 
of independence between the information system development and integration processes and 
configuration management processes to facilitate quality control and more effective oversight.

organizational needs. Related controls: AC-17, CM-8, SC-7. 
Control Enhancements: 
(1) SOFTWARE USAGE RESTRICTIONS | OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE  
The organization establishes the following restrictions on the use of open source software: 
[Assignment: organization-defined restrictions]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Open source software refers to software that is available in source code 
form. Certain software rights normally reserved for copyright holders are routinely provided 
under software license agreements that permit individuals to study, change, and improve the 
software. From a security perspective, the major advantage of open source software is that it 
provides organizations with the ability to examine the source code. However, there are also 
various licensing issues associated with open source software including, for example, the 
constraints on derivative use of such software.

installed, organizations identify permitted and prohibited actions regarding software installation. 
Permitted software installations may include, for example, updates and security patches to existing 
software and downloading applications from organization-approved “app stores.” Prohibited 
software installations may include, for example, software with unknown or suspect pedigrees or 
software that organizations consider potentially malicious. The policies organizations select

a. Develops, documents, and disseminates to [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or 
roles]: 
1. A contingency planning policy that addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, 
management commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and compliance; 
and 
2. Procedures to facilitate the implementation of the contingency planning policy and 
associated contingency planning controls; and 
b. Reviews and updates the current: 
1. Contingency planning policy [Assignment: organization-defined frequency]; and 
2. Contingency planning procedures [Assignment: organization-defined frequency]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  This control addresses the establishment of policy and procedures for the 
effective implementation of selected security controls and control enhancements in the CP family. 
Policy and procedures reflect applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, 
policies, standards, and guidance. Security program policies and procedures at the organization 
level may make the need for system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The policy can 
be included as part of the general information security policy for organizations or conversely, can 
be represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex nature of certain organizations. The 
procedures can be established for the security program in general and for particular information 
systems, if needed. The organizational risk management strategy is a key factor in establishing 
policy and procedures. Related control: PM-9.  
Control Enhancements:  None.

b. Distributes copies of the contingency plan to [Assignment: organization-defined key 
contingency personnel (identified by name and/or by role) and organizational elements]; 
c. Coordinates contingency planning activities with incident handling activities; 
d. Reviews the contingency plan for the information system [Assignment: organization-defined 
frequency]; 
e. Updates the contingency plan to address changes to the organization, information system, or 
environment of operation and problems encountered during contingency plan implementation, 
execution, or testing; 
f. Communicates contingency plan changes to [Assignment: organization-defined key 
contingency personnel (identified by name and/or by role) and organizational elements]; and 
g. Protects the contingency plan from unauthorized disclosure and modification. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Contingency planning for information systems is part of an overall 
organizational program for achieving continuity of operations for mission/business functions. 
Contingency planning addresses both information system restoration and implementation of 
alternative mission/business processes when systems are compromised. The effectiveness of 
contingency planning is maximized by considering such planning throughout the phases of the 
system development life cycle. Performing contingency planning on hardware, software, and 
firmware development can be an effective means of achieving information system resiliency. 
Contingency plans reflect the degree of restoration required for organizational information 
systems since not all systems may need to fully recover to achieve the level of continuity of 
operations desired.  Information system recovery objectives reflect applicable laws, Executive 
Orders, directives, policies, standards, regulations, and guidelines. In addition to information 
system availability, contingency plans also address other security-related events resulting in a 
reduction in mission and/or business effectiveness, such as malicious attacks compromising the 
confidentiality or integrity of information systems. Actions addressed in contingency plans 
include, for example, orderly/graceful degradation, information system shutdown, fallback to a 
manual mode, alternate information flows, and operating in modes reserved for when systems are 
under attack. By closely coordinating contingency planning with incident handling activities, 
organizations can ensure that the necessary contingency planning activities are in place and 
activated in the event of a security incident. Related controls: AC-14, CP-6, CP-7, CP-8, CP-9, 
CP-10, IR-4, IR-8, MP-2, MP-4, MP-5, PM-8, PM-11. 
Control Enhancements: 
(1) CONTINGENCY PLAN | COORDINATE WITH RELATED PLANS  
The organization coordinates contingency plan development with organizational elements 
responsible for related plans. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Plans related to contingency plans for organizational information 
systems include, for example, Business Continuity Plans, Disaster Recovery Plans, Continuity 
of Operations Plans, Crisis Communications Plans, Critical Infrastructure Plans, Cyber 
Incident Response Plans, Insider Threat Implementation Plan, and Occupant Emergency 
Plans. 
(2) CONTINGENCY PLAN | CAPACITY PLANNING 
The organization conducts capacity planning so that necessary capacity for information 
processing, telecommunications, and environmental support exists during contingency 
operations. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Capacity planning is needed because different types of threats (e.g., 
natural disasters, targeted cyber attacks) can result in a reduction of the available processing, 
telecommunications, and support services originally intended to support the organizational 
missions/business functions. Organizations may need to anticipate degraded operations during 
contingency operations and factor such degradation into capacity planning. 
(3) CONTINGENCY PLAN | RESUME ESSENTIAL MISSIONS / BUSINESS FUNCTIONS  
The organization plans for the resumption of essential missions and business functions within 
[Assignment: organization-defined time period] of contingency plan activation.

APPENDIX F-CP   PAGE F-80 
Supplemental Guidance:  Organizations may choose to carry out the contingency planning 
activities in this control enhancement as part of organizational business continuity planning 
including, for example, as part of business impact analyses. The time period for resumption of 
essential missions/business functions may be dependent on the severity/extent of disruptions 
to the information system and its supporting infrastructure. Related control: PE-12. 
(4) CONTINGENCY PLAN | RESUME ALL MISSIONS / BUSINESS FUNCTIONS  
The organization plans for the resumption of all missions and business functions within 
[Assignment: organization-defined time period] of contingency plan activation. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Organizations may choose to carry out the contingency planning 
activities in this control enhancement as part of organizational business continuity planning 
including, for example, as part of business impact analyses. The time period for resumption of 
all missions/business functions may be dependent on the severity/extent of disruptions to the 
information system and its supporting infrastructure. Related control: PE-12. 
(5) CONTINGENCY PLAN | CONTINUE  ESSENTIAL MISSIONS / BUSINESS FUNCTIONS 
The organization plans for the continuance of essential missions and business functions with little 
or no loss of operational continuity and sustains that continuity until full information system 
restoration at primary processing and/or storage sites. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Organizations may choose to carry out the contingency planning 
activities in this control enhancement as part of organizational business continuity planning 
including, for example, as part of business impact analyses. Primary processing and/or storage 
sites defined by organizations as part of contingency planning may change depending on the 
circumstances associated with the contingency (e.g., backup sites may become primary sites). 
Related control: PE-12. 
(6) CONTINGENCY PLAN | ALTERNATE PROCESSING / STORAGE SITE 
The organization plans for the transfer of essential missions and business functions to alternate 
processing and/or storage sites with little or no loss of operational continuity and sustains that 
continuity through information system restoration to primary processing and/or storage sites. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Organizations may choose to carry out the contingency planning 
activities in this control enhancement as part of organizational business continuity planning 
including, for example, as part of business impact analyses. Primary processing and/or storage 
sites defined by organizations as part of contingency planning may change depending on the 
circumstances associated with the contingency (e.g., backup sites may become primary sites). 
Related control: PE-12. 
(7) CONTINGENCY PLAN | COORDINATE  WITH EXTERNAL SERVICE PROVIDERS 
The organization coordinates its contingency plan with the contingency plans of external service 
providers to ensure that contingency requirements can be satisfied. 
Supplemental Guidance:  When the capability of an organization to successfully carry out its 
core missions/business functions is dependent on external service providers, developing a 
timely and comprehensive contingency plan may become more challenging. In this situation, 
organizations coordinate contingency planning activities with the external entities to ensure 
that the individual plans reflect the overall contingency needs of the organization. Related 
control: SA-9. 
(8) CONTINGENCY PLAN | IDENTIFY CRITICAL ASSETS  
The organization identifies critical information system assets supporting essential missions and 
business functions. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Organizations may choose to carry out the contingency planning 
activities in this control enhancement as part of organizational business continuity planning 
including, for example, as part of business impact analyses. Organizations identify critical 
information system assets so that additional safeguards and countermeasures can be employed 
(above and beyond those safeguards and countermeasures routinely implemented) to help 
ensure that organizational missions/business functions can continue to be conducted during 
contingency operations. In addition, the identification of critical information assets facilitates 
the prioritization of organizational resources. Critical information system assets include 
technical and operational aspects. Technical aspects include, for example, information

CP-3 CONTINGENCY TRAINING 
 Control:  The organization provides contingency training to information system users consistent 
with assigned roles and responsibilities:  
a. Within [Assignment: organization-defined time period] of assuming a contingency role or 
responsibility; 
b. When required by information system changes; and 
c. [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] thereafter. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Contingency training provided by organizations is linked to the assigned 
roles and responsibilities of organizational personnel to ensure that the appropriate content and 
level of detail is included in such training. For example, regular users may only need to know 
when and where to report for duty during contingency operations and if normal duties are affected; 
system administrators may require additional training on how to set up information systems at 
alternate processing and storage sites; and managers/senior leaders may receive more specific 
training on how to conduct mission-essential functions in designated off-site locations and how to 
establish communications with other governmental entities for purposes of coordination on 
contingency-related activities. Training for contingency roles/responsibilities reflects the specific 
continuity requirements in the contingency plan. Related controls: AT-2, AT-3, CP-2, IR-2.

c. Initiates corrective actions, if needed. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Methods for testing contingency plans to determine the effectiveness of the 
plans and to identify potential weaknesses in the plans include, for example, walk-through and 
tabletop exercises, checklists, simulations (parallel, full interrupt), and comprehensive exercises. 
Organizations conduct testing based on the continuity requirements in contingency plans and 
include a determination of the effects on organizational operations, assets, and individuals arising 
due to contingency operations. Organizations have flexibility and discretion in the breadth, depth, 
and timelines of corrective actions. Related controls: CP-2, CP-3, IR-3. 
Control Enhancements: 
(1) CONTINGENCY PLAN TESTING | COORDINATE WITH RELATED PLANS  
The organization coordinates contingency plan testing with organizational elements responsible 
for related plans. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Plans related to contingency plans for organizational information 
systems include, for example, Business Continuity Plans, Disaster Recovery Plans, Continuity 
of Operations Plans, Crisis Communications Plans, Critical Infrastructure Plans, Cyber 
Incident Response Plans, and Occupant Emergency Plans. This control enhancement does not 
require organizations to create organizational elements to handle related plans or to align such 
elements with specific plans. It does require, however, that if such organizational elements are 
responsible for related plans, organizations should coordinate with those elements. Related 
controls: IR-8, PM-8. 
(2) CONTINGENCY PLAN TESTING | ALTERNATE PROCESSING SITE  
The organization tests the contingency plan at the alternate processing site: 
(a) To familiarize contingency personnel with the facility and available resources; and 
(b) To evaluate the capabilities of the alternate processing site to support contingency 
operations. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Related control: CP-7. 
(3) CONTINGENCY PLAN TESTING | AUTOMATED TESTING 
The organization employs automated mechanisms to more thoroughly and effectively test the 
contingency plan. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Automated mechanisms provide more thorough and effective testing 
of contingency plans, for example: (i) by providing more complete coverage of contingency 
issues; (ii) by selecting more realistic test scenarios and environments; and (iii) by effectively 
stressing the information system and supported missions.

CP-6 ALTERNATE STORAGE SITE 
 Control:  The organization: 
a. Establishes an alternate storage site including necessary agreements to permit the storage and 
retrieval of information system backup information; and 
b. Ensures that the alternate storage site provides information security safeguards equivalent to 
that of the primary site. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Alternate storage sites are sites that are geographically distinct from 
primary storage sites. An alternate storage site maintains duplicate copies of information and data 
in the event that the primary storage site is not available. Items covered by alternate storage site 
agreements include, for example, environmental conditions at alternate sites, access rules, physical 
and environmental protection requirements, and coordination of delivery/retrieval of backup 
media. Alternate storage sites reflect the requirements in contingency plans so that organizations 
can maintain essential missions/business functions despite disruption, compromise, or failure in 
organizational information systems. Related controls: CP-2, CP-7, CP-9, CP-10, MP-4. 
Control Enhancements: 
(1) ALTERNATE STORAGE SITE | SEPARATION FROM PRIMARY SITE  
The organization identifies an alternate storage site that is separated from the primary storage site 
to reduce susceptibility to the same threats. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Threats that affect alternate storage sites are typically defined in 
organizational assessments of risk and include, for example, natural disasters, structural 
failures, hostile cyber attacks, and errors of omission/commission. Organizations determine 
what is considered a sufficient degree of separation between primary and alternate storage 
sites based on the types of threats that are of concern. For one particular type of threat (i.e., 
hostile cyber attack), the degree of separation between sites is less relevant. Related control: 
RA-3. 
(2) ALTERNATE STORAGE SITE | RECOVERY TIME / POINT OBJECTIVES 
The organization configures the alternate storage site to facilitate recovery operations in 
accordance with recovery time and recovery point objectives.  
(3) ALTERNATE STORAGE SITE | ACCESSIBILITY  
The organization identifies potential accessibility problems to the alternate storage site in the 
event of an area-wide disruption or disaster and outlines explicit mitigation actions. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Area-wide disruptions refer to those types of disruptions that are broad 
in geographic scope (e.g., hurricane, regional power outage) with such determinations made 
by organizations based on organizational assessments of risk. Explicit mitigation actions 
include, for example: (i) duplicating backup information at other alternate storage sites if 
access problems occur at originally designated alternate sites; or (ii) planning for physical 
access to retrieve backup information if electronic accessibility to the alternate site is 
disrupted. Related control: RA-3.

CP-8 TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES 
 Control:  The organization establishes alternate telecommunications services including necessary 
agreements to permit the resumption of [Assignment: organization-defined information system 
operations] for essential missions and business functions within [Assignment: organization-
defined time period] when the primary telecommunications capabilities are unavailable at either 
the primary or alternate processing or storage sites. 
Supplemental Guidance:  This control applies to telecommunications services (data and voice) for 
primary and alternate processing and storage sites. Alternate telecommunications services reflect 
the continuity requirements in contingency plans to maintain essential missions/business functions 
despite the loss of primary telecommunications services. Organizations may specify different time 
periods for primary/alternate sites. Alternate telecommunications services include, for example, 
additional organizational or commercial ground-based circuits/lines or satellites in lieu of ground-
based communications. Organizations consider factors such as availability, quality of service, and 
access when entering into alternate telecommunications agreements. Related controls: CP-2, CP-6, 
CP-7. 
Control Enhancements: 
(1) TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES | PRIORITY OF SERVICE PROVISIONS  
The organization: 
(a) Develops primary and alternate telecommunications service agreements that contain priority-
of-service provisions in accordance with organizational availability requirements (including 
recovery time objectives); and 
(b) Requests Telecommunications Service Priority for all telecommunications services used for 
national security emergency preparedness in the event that the primary and/or alternate 
telecommunications services are provided by a common carrier. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Organizations consider the potential mission/business impact in 
situations where telecommunications service providers are servicing other organizations with 
similar priority-of-service provisions. 
(2) TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES | SINGLE POINTS OF FAILURE  
The organization obtains alternate telecommunications services to reduce the likelihood of sharing 
a single point of failure with primary telecommunications services.  
(3) TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES | SEPARATION OF PRIMARY / ALTERNATE PROVIDERS 
The organization obtains alternate telecommunications services from providers that are separated 
from primary service providers to reduce susceptibility to the same threats. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Threats that affect telecommunications services are typically defined 
in organizational assessments of risk and include, for example, natural disasters, structural 
failures, hostile cyber/physical attacks, and errors of omission/commission. Organizations 
seek to reduce common susceptibilities by, for example, minimizing shared infrastructure 
among telecommunications service providers and achieving sufficient geographic separation 
between services. Organizations may consider using a single service provider in situations 
where the service provider can provide alternate telecommunications services meeting the 
separation needs addressed in the risk assessment.

CP-10 INFORMATION SYSTEM RECOVERY AND RECONSTITUTION 
 Control:  The organization provides for the recovery and reconstitution of the information system to 
a known state after a disruption, compromise, or failure. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Recovery is executing information system contingency plan activities to 
restore organizational missions/business functions. Reconstitution takes place following recovery 
and includes activities for returning organizational information systems to fully operational states. 
Recovery and reconstitution operations reflect mission and business priorities, recovery point/time 
and reconstitution objectives, and established organizational metrics consistent with contingency 
plan requirements. Reconstitution includes the deactivation of any interim information system 
capabilities that may have been needed during recovery operations. Reconstitution also includes

 Control:  The information system provides the capability to employ [Assignment: organization-
defined alternative communications protocols] in support of maintaining continuity of operations. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Contingency plans and the associated training and testing for those plans, 
incorporate an alternate communications protocol capability as part of increasing the resilience of 
organizational information systems. Alternate communications protocols include, for example, 
switching from Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) Version 4 to TCP/IP 
Version 6. Switching communications protocols may affect software applications and therefore, 
the potential side effects of introducing alternate communications protocols are analyzed prior to 
implementation.

safe mode of operation]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  For information systems supporting critical missions/business functions 
including, for example, military operations and weapons systems, civilian space operations, 
nuclear power plant operations, and air traffic control operations (especially real-time operational 
environments), organizations may choose to identify certain conditions under which those systems 
revert to a predefined safe mode of operation. The safe mode of operation, which can be activated 
automatically or manually, restricts the types of activities or operations information systems could 
execute when those conditions are encountered. Restriction includes, for example, allowing only 
certain functions that could be carried out under limited power or with reduced communications 
bandwidth.

CP-13 ALTERNATIVE SECURITY MECHANISMS 
 Control:  The organization employs [Assignment: organization-defined alternative or supplemental 
security mechanisms] for satisfying [Assignment: organization-defined security functions] when 
the primary means of implementing the security function is unavailable or compromised. 
Supplemental Guidance:  This control supports information system resiliency and contingency 
planning/continuity of operations. To ensure mission/business continuity, organizations can 
implement alternative or supplemental security mechanisms. These mechanisms may be less 
effective than the primary mechanisms (e.g., not as easy to use, not as scalable, or not as secure). 
However, having the capability to readily employ these alternative/supplemental mechanisms 
enhances overall mission/business continuity that might otherwise be adversely impacted if 
organizational operations had to be curtailed until the primary means of implementing the 
functions was restored. Given the cost and level of effort required to provide such alternative 
capabilities, this control would typically be applied only to critical security capabilities provided 
by information systems, system components, or information system services. For example, an 
organization may issue to senior executives and system administrators one-time pads in case 
multifactor tokens, the organization’s standard means for secure remote authentication, is 
compromised. Related control: CP-2.

a. Develops, documents, and disseminates to [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or 
roles]: 
1. An identification and authentication policy that addresses purpose, scope, roles, 
responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among organizational entities, 
and compliance; and 
2. Procedures to facilitate the implementation of the identification and authentication policy 
and associated identification and authentication controls; and 
b. Reviews and updates the current: 
1. Identification and authentication policy [Assignment: organization-defined frequency]; 
and 
2. Identification and authentication procedures [Assignment: organization-defined

Supplemental Guidance:  This control addresses the establishment of policy and procedures for the 
effective implementation of selected security controls and control enhancements in the IA family. 
Policy and procedures reflect applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, 
policies, standards, and guidance. Security program policies and procedures at the organization 
level may make the need for system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The policy can 
be included as part of the general information security policy for organizations or conversely, can 
be represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex nature of certain organizations. The 
procedures can be established for the security program in general and for particular information 
systems, if needed. The organizational risk management strategy is a key factor in establishing 
policy and procedures. Related control: PM-9.

IA-2 IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION (ORGANIZATIONAL USERS) 
 Control:  The information system uniquely identifies and authenticates organizational users (or 
processes acting on behalf of organizational users). 
Supplemental Guidance:  Organizational users include employees or individuals that organizations 
deem to have equivalent status of employees (e.g., contractors, guest researchers). This control 
applies to all accesses other than: (i) accesses that are explicitly identified and documented in AC-
14; and (ii) accesses that occur through authorized use of group authenticators without individual 
authentication. Organizations may require unique identification of individuals in group accounts 
(e.g., shared privilege accounts) or for detailed accountability of individual activity. Organizations 
employ passwords, tokens, or biometrics to authenticate user identities, or in the case multifactor 
authentication, or some combination thereof. Access to organizational information systems is 
defined as either local access or network access. Local access is any access to organizational 
information systems by users (or processes acting on behalf of users) where such access is 
obtained by direct connections without the use of networks. Network access is access to 
Special Publication 800-53 Revision 4                                  Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems 
                                                                                               and Organizations 
________________________________________________________________________________________________ 
APPENDIX F-IA   PAGE F-91 
organizational information systems by users (or processes acting on behalf of users) where such 
access is obtained through network connections (i.e., nonlocal accesses). Remote access is a type 
of network access that involves communication through external networks (e.g., the Internet). 
Internal networks include local area networks and wide area networks. In addition, the use of 
encrypted virtual private networks (VPNs) for network connections between organization-
controlled endpoints and non-organization controlled endpoints may be treated as internal 
networks from the perspective of protecting the confidentiality and integrity of information 
traversing the network. 
Organizations can satisfy the identification and authentication requirements in this control by 
complying with the requirements in Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 consistent with 
the specific organizational implementation plans. Multifactor authentication requires the use of 
two or more different factors to achieve authentication. The factors are defined as: (i) something 
you know (e.g., password, personal identification number [PIN]); (ii) something you have (e.g., 
cryptographic identification device, token); or (iii) something you are (e.g., biometric). Multifactor 
solutions that require devices separate from information systems gaining access include, for 
example, hardware tokens providing time-based or challenge-response authenticators and smart 
cards such as the U.S. Government Personal Identity Verification card and the DoD common 
access card. In addition to identifying and authenticating users at the information system level 
(i.e., at logon), organizations also employ identification and authentication mechanisms at the 
application level, when necessary, to provide increased information security. Identification and 
authentication requirements for other than organizational users are described in IA-8. Related 
controls: AC-2, AC-3, AC-14, AC-17, AC-18, IA-4, IA-5, IA-8. 
Control Enhancements:

The information system implements multifactor authentication for network access to privileged 
accounts. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Related control: AC-6. 
(2) IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION | NETWORK ACCESS TO NON-PRIVILEGED ACCOUNTS  
The information system implements multifactor authentication for network access to non-
privileged accounts. 
(3) IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION | LOCAL ACCESS TO PRIVILEGED ACCOUNTS  
The information system implements multifactor authentication for local access to privileged 
accounts. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Related control: AC-6. 
(4) IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION | LOCAL ACCESS TO NON-PRIVILEGED ACCOUNTS  
The information system implements multifactor authentication for local access to non-privileged 
accounts. 
(5) IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION | GROUP AUTHENTICATION  
The organization requires individuals to be authenticated with an individual authenticator when a 
group authenticator is employed. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Requiring individuals to use individual authenticators as a second level 
of authentication helps organizations to mitigate the risk of using group authenticators. 
(6) IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION | NETWORK ACCESS TO PRIVILEGED ACCOUNTS - SEPARATE DEVICE  
The information system implements multifactor authentication for network access to privileged 
accounts such that one of the factors is provided by a device separate from the system gaining 
access and the device meets [Assignment: organization-defined strength of mechanism 
requirements].

(8) IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION | NETWORK ACCESS TO PRIVILEGED ACCOUNTS - REPLAY RESISTANT  
The information system implements replay-resistant authentication mechanisms for network 
access to privileged accounts. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Authentication processes resist replay attacks if it is impractical to 
achieve successful authentications by replaying previous authentication messages. Replay-
resistant techniques include, for example, protocols that use nonces or challenges such as 
Transport Layer Security (TLS) and time synchronous or challenge-response one-time 
authenticators. 
(9) IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION | NETWORK ACCESS TO NON-PRIVILEGED ACCOUNTS - REPLAY RESISTANT  
The information system implements replay-resistant authentication mechanisms for network 
access to non-privileged accounts. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Authentication processes resist replay attacks if it is impractical to 
achieve successful authentications by recording/replaying previous authentication messages. 
Replay-resistant techniques include, for example, protocols that use nonces or challenges such 
as Transport Layer Security (TLS) and time synchronous or challenge-response one-time 
authenticators. 
(10) IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION | SINGLE SIGN-ON  
The information system provides a single sign-on capability for [Assignment: organization-defined 
list of information system accounts and services]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Single sign-on enables users to log in once and gain access to multiple 
information system resources. Organizations consider the operational efficiencies provided by 
single sign-on capabilities with the increased risk from disclosures of single authenticators 
providing access to multiple system resources. 
(11) IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION | REMOTE ACCESS  - SEPARATE DEVICE  
The information system implements multifactor authentication for remote access to privileged and 
non-privileged accounts such that one of the factors is provided by a device separate from the 
system gaining access and the device meets [Assignment: organization-defined strength of 
mechanism requirements]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  For remote access to privileged/non-privileged accounts, the purpose 
of requiring a device that is separate from the information system gaining access for one of 
the factors during multifactor authentication is to reduce the likelihood of compromising 
authentication credentials stored on the system. For example, adversaries deploying malicious 
code on organizational information systems can potentially compromise such credentials 
resident on the system and subsequently impersonate authorized users. Related control: AC-6. 
(12) IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION | ACCEPTANCE OF PIV CREDENTIALS  
The information system accepts and electronically verifies Personal Identity Verification (PIV) 
credentials. 
Supplemental Guidance:  This control enhancement applies to organizations implementing 
logical access control systems (LACS) and physical access control systems (PACS). Personal 
Identity Verification (PIV) credentials are those credentials issued by federal agencies that 
conform to FIPS Publication 201 and supporting guidance documents. OMB Memorandum 
11-11 requires federal agencies to continue implementing the requirements specified in 
HSPD-12 to enable agency-wide use of PIV credentials. Related controls: AU-2, PE-3, SA-4. 
(13) IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION | OUT-OF-BAND AUTHENTICATION  
The information system implements [Assignment: organization-defined out-of-band authentication] 
under [Assignment: organization-defined conditions]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Out-of-band authentication (OOBA) refers to the use of two separate 
communication paths to identify and authenticate users or devices to an information system. 
The first path (i.e., the in-band path), is used to identify and authenticate users or devices, and 
generally is the path through which information flows. The second path (i.e., the out-of-band 
path) is used to independently verify the authentication and/or requested action. For example, 
a user authenticates via a notebook computer to a remote server to which the user desires 
access, and requests some action of the server via that communication path. Subsequently, the 
server contacts the user via the user’s cell phone to verify that the requested action originated

from the user. The user may either confirm the intended action to an individual on the 
telephone or provide an authentication code via the telephone. This type of authentication can 
be employed by organizations to mitigate actual or suspected man-in the-middle attacks. The 
conditions for activation can include, for example, suspicious activities, new threat indicators 
or elevated threat levels, or the impact level or classification level of information in requested 
transactions. Related controls: IA-10, IA-11, SC-37.

IA-3 DEVICE IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION 
Control:  The information system uniquely identifies and authenticates [Assignment: organization-
defined specific and/or types of devices] before establishing a [Selection (one or more): local; 
remote; network] connection. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Organizational devices requiring unique device-to-device identification and 
authentication may be defined by type, by device, or by a combination of type/device. Information 
systems typically use either shared known information (e.g., Media Access Control [MAC] or 
Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol [TCP/IP] addresses) for device identification or 
organizational authentication solutions (e.g., IEEE 802.1x and Extensible Authentication Protocol 
[EAP], Radius server with EAP-Transport Layer Security [TLS] authentication, Kerberos) to 
identify/authenticate devices on local and/or wide area networks. Organizations determine the 
required strength of authentication mechanisms by the security categories of information systems. 
Because of the challenges of applying this control on large scale, organizations are encouraged to 
only apply the control to those limited number (and type) of devices that truly need to support this 
capability. Related controls: AC-17, AC-18, AC-19, CA-3, IA-4, IA-5.

The information system authenticates [Assignment: organization-defined specific devices and/or 
types of devices] before establishing [Selection (one or more): local; remote; network] connection 
using bidirectional authentication that is cryptographically based. 
Supplemental Guidance:  A local connection is any connection with a device communicating 
without the use of a network. A network connection is any connection with a device that 
communicates through a network (e.g., local area or wide area network, Internet). A remote 
connection is any connection with a device communicating through an external network (e.g., 
the Internet). Bidirectional authentication provides stronger safeguards to validate the identity 
of other devices for connections that are of greater risk (e.g., remote connections). Related

(4) DEVICE IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION | DEVICE ATTESTATION  
The organization ensures that device identification and authentication based on attestation is 
handled by [Assignment: organization-defined configuration management process]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Device attestation refers to the identification and authentication of a 
device based on its configuration and known operating state. This might be determined via 
some cryptographic hash of the device. If device attestation is the means of identification and 
authentication, then it is important that patches and updates to the device are handled via a 
configuration management process such that the those patches/updates are done securely and 
at the same time do not disrupt the identification and authentication to other devices.

IA-4 IDENTIFIER MANAGEMENT 
 Control:  The organization manages information system identifiers by: 
a. Receiving authorization from [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles] to assign 
an individual, group, role, or device identifier; 
b. Selecting an identifier that identifies an individual, group, role, or device; 
c. Assigning the identifier to the intended individual, group, role, or device; 
d. Preventing reuse of identifiers for [Assignment: organization-defined time period]; and 
e. Disabling the identifier after [Assignment: organization-defined time period of inactivity]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Common device identifiers include, for example, media access control 
(MAC), Internet protocol (IP) addresses, or device-unique token identifiers. Management of 
individual identifiers is not applicable to shared information system accounts (e.g., guest and 
anonymous accounts). Typically, individual identifiers are the user names of the information 
system accounts assigned to those individuals. In such instances, the account management 
activities of AC-2 use account names provided by IA-4. This control also addresses individual 
identifiers not necessarily associated with information system accounts (e.g., identifiers used in 
physical security control databases accessed by badge reader systems for access to information 
systems). Preventing reuse of identifiers implies preventing the assignment of previously used 
individual, group, role, or device identifiers to different individuals, groups, roles, or devices. 
Related controls: AC-2, IA-2, IA-3, IA-5, IA-8, SC-37. 
Control Enhancements: 
(1) IDENTIFIER MANAGEMENT | PROHIBIT ACCOUNT IDENTIFIERS AS PUBLIC IDENTIFIERS 
The organization prohibits the use of information system account identifiers that are the same as 
public identifiers for individual electronic mail accounts. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Prohibiting the use of information systems account identifiers that are 
the same as some public identifier such as the individual identifier section of an electronic 
mail address, makes it more difficult for adversaries to guess user identifiers on organizational 
information systems. Related control: AT-2.

Supplemental Guidance:  Requiring multiple forms of identification reduces the likelihood of 
individuals using fraudulent identification to establish an identity, or at least increases the 
work factor of potential adversaries. 
(4) IDENTIFIER MANAGEMENT | IDENTIFY USER STATUS  
The organization manages individual identifiers by uniquely identifying each individual as 
[Assignment: organization-defined characteristic identifying individual status]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Characteristics identifying the status of individuals include, for 
example, contractors and foreign nationals. Identifying the status of individuals by specific 
characteristics provides additional information about the people with whom organizational 
personnel are communicating. For example, it might be useful for a government employee to 
know that one of the individuals on an email message is a contractor. Related control: AT-2. 
(5) IDENTIFIER MANAGEMENT | DYNAMIC MANAGEMENT  
The information system dynamically manages identifiers. 
Supplemental Guidance:  In contrast to conventional approaches to identification which presume 
static accounts for preregistered users, many distributed information systems including, for 
example, service-oriented architectures, rely on establishing identifiers at run time for entities 
that were previously unknown. In these situations, organizations anticipate and provision for 
the dynamic establishment of identifiers. Preestablished trust relationships and mechanisms 
with appropriate authorities to validate identities and related credentials are essential. Related 
control: AC-16. 
(6) IDENTIFIER MANAGEMENT | CROSS-ORGANIZATION MANAGEMENT  
The organization coordinates with [Assignment: organization-defined external organizations] for 
cross-organization management of identifiers. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Cross-organization identifier management provides the capability for 
organizations to appropriately identify individuals, groups, roles, or devices when conducting 
cross-organization activities involving the processing, storage, or transmission of information. 
(7) IDENTIFIER MANAGEMENT | IN-PERSON REGISTRATION 
The organization requires that the registration process to receive an individual identifier be 
conducted in person before a designated registration authority. 
Supplemental Guidance:  In-person registration reduces the likelihood of fraudulent identifiers 
being issued because it requires the physical presence of individuals and actual face-to-face 
interactions with designated registration authorities.

 Control:  The organization manages information system authenticators by: 
a. Verifying, as part of the initial authenticator distribution, the identity of the individual, group, 
role, or device receiving the authenticator; 
b. Establishing initial authenticator content for authenticators defined by the organization; 
c. Ensuring that authenticators have sufficient strength of mechanism for their intended use;

d. Establishing and implementing administrative procedures for initial authenticator distribution, 
for lost/compromised or damaged authenticators, and for revoking authenticators; 
e. Changing default content of authenticators prior to information system installation; 
f. Establishing minimum and maximum lifetime restrictions and reuse conditions for 
authenticators; 
g. Changing/refreshing authenticators [Assignment: organization-defined time period by 
authenticator type]; 
h. Protecting authenticator content from unauthorized disclosure and modification; 
i. Requiring individuals to take, and having devices implement, specific security safeguards to 
protect authenticators; and 
j. Changing authenticators for group/role accounts when membership to those accounts changes. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Individual authenticators include, for example, passwords, tokens, 
biometrics, PKI certificates, and key cards. Initial authenticator content is the actual content (e.g., 
the initial password) as opposed to requirements about authenticator content (e.g., minimum 
password length). In many cases, developers ship information system components with factory 
default authentication credentials to allow for initial installation and configuration. Default 
authentication credentials are often well known, easily discoverable, and present a significant 
security risk. The requirement to protect individual authenticators may be implemented via control 
PL-4 or PS-6 for authenticators in the possession of individuals and by controls AC-3, AC-6, and 
SC-28 for authenticators stored within organizational information systems (e.g., passwords stored 
in hashed or encrypted formats, files containing encrypted or hashed passwords accessible with 
administrator privileges). Information systems support individual authenticator management by 
organization-defined settings and restrictions for various authenticator characteristics including, 
for example, minimum password length, password composition, validation time window for time 
synchronous one-time tokens, and number of allowed rejections during the verification stage of 
biometric authentication. Specific actions that can be taken to safeguard authenticators include, for 
example, maintaining possession of individual authenticators, not loaning or sharing individual 
authenticators with others, and reporting lost, stolen, or compromised authenticators immediately. 
Authenticator management includes issuing and revoking, when no longer needed, authenticators 
for temporary access such as that required for remote maintenance. Device authenticators include, 
for example, certificates and passwords. Related controls: AC-2, AC-3, AC-6, CM-6, IA-2, IA-4, 
IA-8, PL-4, PS-5, PS-6, SC-12, SC-13, SC-17, SC-28. 
Control Enhancements:  
(1) AUTHENTICATOR MANAGEMENT | PASSWORD-BASED AUTHENTICATION  
The information system, for password-based authentication: 
(a) Enforces minimum password complexity of [Assignment: organization-defined requirements 
for case sensitivity, number of characters, mix of upper-case letters, lower-case letters, 
numbers, and special characters, including minimum requirements for each type]; 
(b) Enforces at least the following number of changed characters when new passwords are 
created: [Assignment: organization-defined number]; 
(c) Stores and transmits only encrypted representations of passwords; 
(d) Enforces password minimum and maximum lifetime restrictions of [Assignment: organization-
defined numbers for lifetime minimum, lifetime maximum]; 
(e) Prohibits password reuse for [Assignment: organization-defined number] generations; and 
(f) Allows the use of a temporary password for system logons with an immediate change to a 
permanent password. 
Supplemental Guidance:  This control enhancement applies to single-factor authentication of 
individuals using passwords as individual or group authenticators, and in a similar manner, 
when passwords are part of multifactor authenticators. This control enhancement does not 
apply when passwords are used to unlock hardware authenticators (e.g., Personal Identity

________________________________________________________________________________________________ 
APPENDIX F-IA   PAGE F-97 
Verification cards). The implementation of such password mechanisms may not meet all of 
the requirements in the enhancement. Encrypted representations of passwords include, for 
example, encrypted versions of passwords and one-way cryptographic hashes of passwords. 
The number of changed characters refers to the number of changes required with respect to 
the total number of positions in the current password. Password lifetime restrictions do not 
apply to temporary passwords. Related control: IA-6. 
(2) AUTHENTICATOR MANAGEMENT | PKI-BASED AUTHENTICATION  
The information system, for PKI-based authentication: 
(a) Validates certifications by constructing and verifying a certification path to an accepted trust 
anchor including checking certificate status information; 
(b) Enforces authorized access to the corresponding private key; 
(c) Maps the authenticated identity to the account of the individual or group; and 
(d) Implements a local cache of revocation data to support path discovery and validation in case 
of inability to access revocation information via the network. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Status information for certification paths includes, for example, 
certificate revocation lists or certificate status protocol responses. For PIV cards, validation of 
certifications involves the construction and verification of a certification path to the Common 
Policy Root trust anchor including certificate policy processing. Related control: IA-6. 
(3) AUTHENTICATOR MANAGEMENT | IN-PERSON OR TRUSTED THIRD-PARTY REGISTRATION  
The organization requires that the registration process to receive [Assignment: organization-
defined types of and/or specific authenticators] be conducted [Selection: in person; by a trusted 
third party] before [Assignment: organization-defined registration authority] with authorization by 
[Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles]. 
(4) AUTHENTICATOR MANAGEMENT | AUTOMATED SUPPORT  FOR PASSWORD STRENGTH DETERMINATION 
The organization employs automated tools to determine if password authenticators are sufficiently 
strong to satisfy [Assignment: organization-defined requirements]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  This control enhancement focuses on the creation of strong passwords 
and the characteristics of such passwords (e.g., complexity) prior to use, the enforcement of 
which is carried out by organizational information systems in IA-5 (1). Related controls: CA-
2, CA-7, RA-5. 
(5) AUTHENTICATOR MANAGEMENT | CHANGE AUTHENTICATORS PRIOR TO DELIVERY  
The organization requires developers/installers of information system components to provide 
unique authenticators or change default authenticators prior to delivery/installation. 
Supplemental Guidance:  This control enhancement extends the requirement for organizations to 
change default authenticators upon information system installation, by requiring developers 
and/or installers to provide unique authenticators or change default authenticators for system 
components prior to delivery and/or installation. However, it typically does not apply to the 
developers of commercial off-the-shelve information technology products. Requirements for 
unique authenticators can be included in acquisition documents prepared by organizations 
when procuring information systems or system components. 
(6) AUTHENTICATOR MANAGEMENT | PROTECTION OF AUTHENTICATORS  
The organization protects authenticators commensurate with the security category of the 
information to which use of the authenticator permits access. 
Supplemental Guidance:  For information systems containing multiple security categories of 
information without reliable physical or logical separation between categories, authenticators 
used to grant access to the systems are protected commensurate with the highest security 
category of information on the systems. 
(7) AUTHENTICATOR MANAGEMENT | NO EMBEDDED UNENCRYPTED STATIC AUTHENTICATORS  
The organization ensures that unencrypted static authenticators are not embedded in applications 
or access scripts or stored on function keys. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Organizations exercise caution in determining whether embedded or 
stored authenticators are in encrypted or unencrypted form. If authenticators are used in the 
manner stored, then those representations are considered unencrypted authenticators. This is 
Special Publication 800-53 Revision 4                                  Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems 
                                                                                               and Organizations 
________________________________________________________________________________________________ 
APPENDIX F-IA   PAGE F-98 
irrespective of whether that representation is perhaps an encrypted version of something else 
(e.g., a password). 
(8) AUTHENTICATOR MANAGEMENT | MULTIPLE INFORMATION SYSTEM ACCOUNTS  
The organization implements [Assignment: organization-defined security safeguards] to manage 
the risk of compromise due to individuals having accounts on multiple information systems. 
Supplemental Guidance:  When individuals have accounts on multiple information systems, 
there is the risk that the compromise of one account may lead to the compromise of other 
accounts if individuals use the same authenticators. Possible alternatives include, for example: 
(i) having different authenticators on all systems; (ii) employing some form of single sign-on 
mechanism; or (iii) including some form of one-time passwords on all systems. 
(9) AUTHENTICATOR MANAGEMENT | CROSS-ORGANIZATION CREDENTIAL MANAGEMENT  
The organization coordinates with [Assignment: organization-defined external organizations] for 
cross-organization management of credentials. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Cross-organization management of credentials provides the capability 
for organizations to appropriately authenticate individuals, groups, roles, or devices when 
conducting cross-organization activities involving the processing, storage, or transmission of 
information. 
(10) AUTHENTICATOR MANAGEMENT | DYNAMIC CREDENTIAL ASSOCIATION 
The information system dynamically provisions identities. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Authentication requires some form of binding between an identity and 
the authenticator used to confirm the identity. In conventional approaches, this binding is 
established by pre-provisioning both the identity and the authenticator to the information 
system. For example, the binding between a username (i.e., identity) and a password (i.e., 
authenticator) is accomplished by provisioning the identity and authenticator as a pair in the 
information system. New authentication techniques allow the binding between the identity 
and the authenticator to be implemented outside an information system. For example, with 
smartcard credentials, the identity and the authenticator are bound together on the card. Using 
these credentials, information systems can authenticate identities that have not been pre-
provisioned, dynamically provisioning the identity after authentication. In these situations, 
organizations can anticipate the dynamic provisioning of identities. Preestablished trust 
relationships and mechanisms with appropriate authorities to validate identities and related 
credentials are essential. 
(11) AUTHENTICATOR MANAGEMENT | HARDWARE TOKEN-BASED AUTHENTICATION  
The information system, for hardware token-based authentication, employs mechanisms that 
satisfy [Assignment: organization-defined token quality requirements]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Hardware token-based authentication typically refers to the use of 
PKI-based tokens, such as the U.S. Government Personal Identity Verification (PIV) card. 
Organizations define specific requirements for tokens, such as working with a particular PKI. 
(12) AUTHENTICATOR MANAGEMENT | BIOMETRIC AUTHENTICATION  
The information system, for biometric-based authentication, employs mechanisms that satisfy 
[Assignment: organization-defined biometric quality requirements]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Unlike password-based authentication which provides exact matches 
of user-input passwords to stored passwords, biometric authentication does not provide such 
exact matches. Depending upon the type of biometric and the type of collection mechanism, 
there is likely to be some divergence from the presented biometric and stored biometric which 
serves as the basis of comparison. There will likely be both false positives and false negatives 
when making such comparisons. The rate at which the false accept and false reject rates are 
equal is known as the crossover rate. Biometric quality requirements include, for example, 
acceptable crossover rates, as that essentially reflects the accuracy of the biometric. 
(13) AUTHENTICATOR MANAGEMENT | EXPIRATION OF CACHED AUTHENTICATORS  
The information system prohibits the use of cached authenticators after [Assignment: 
organization-defined time period]. 
(14) AUTHENTICATOR MANAGEMENT | MANAGING CONTENT OF PKI TRUST STORES

networks, operating systems, browsers, and applications.  
(15) AUTHENTICATOR MANAGEMENT | FICAM-APPROVED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES  
The organization uses only FICAM-approved path discovery and validation products and services. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Federal Identity, Credential, and Access Management (FICAM)-
approved path discovery and validation products and services are those products and services 
that have been approved through the FICAM conformance program, where applicable.

IA-6 AUTHENTICATOR FEEDBACK 
Control:  The information system obscures feedback of authentication information during the 
authentication process to protect the information from possible exploitation/use by unauthorized 
individuals. 
Supplemental Guidance:  The feedback from information systems does not provide information that 
would allow unauthorized individuals to compromise authentication mechanisms. For some types 
of information systems or system components, for example, desktops/notebooks with relatively 
large monitors, the threat (often referred to as shoulder surfing) may be significant. For other types 
of systems or components, for example, mobile devices with 2-4 inch screens, this threat may be 
less significant, and may need to be balanced against the increased likelihood of typographic input 
errors due to the small keyboards. Therefore, the means for obscuring the authenticator feedback is 
selected accordingly. Obscuring the feedback of authentication information includes, for example, 
displaying asterisks when users type passwords into input devices, or displaying feedback for a 
very limited time before fully obscuring it. Related control: PE-18.

IA-8 IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION (NON-ORGANIZATIONAL USERS) 
 Control:  The information system uniquely identifies and authenticates non-organizational users (or 
processes acting on behalf of non-organizational users). 
Supplemental Guidance:  Non-organizational users include information system users other than 
organizational users explicitly covered by IA-2. These individuals are uniquely identified and 
authenticated for accesses other than those accesses explicitly identified and documented in AC-
14. In accordance with the E-Authentication E-Government initiative, authentication of non-
organizational users accessing federal information systems may be required to protect federal, 
proprietary, or privacy-related information (with exceptions noted for national security systems). 
Organizations use risk assessments to determine authentication needs and consider scalability, 
practicality, and security in balancing the need to ensure ease of use for access to federal 
information and information systems with the need to protect and adequately mitigate risk. IA-2 
addresses identification and authentication requirements for access to information systems by 
organizational users. Related controls: AC-2, AC-14, AC-17, AC-18, IA-2, IA-4, IA-5, MA-4, 
RA-3, SA-12, SC-8. 
Control Enhancements: 
(1) IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION | ACCEPTANCE OF PIV CREDENTIALS FROM OTHER AGENCIES 
The information system accepts and electronically verifies Personal Identity Verification (PIV) 
credentials from other federal agencies. 
Supplemental Guidance:  This control enhancement applies to logical access control systems 
(LACS) and physical access control systems (PACS). Personal Identity Verification (PIV) 
credentials are those credentials issued by federal agencies that conform to FIPS Publication 
201 and supporting guidance documents. OMB Memorandum 11-11 requires federal agencies 
to continue implementing the requirements specified in HSPD-12 to enable agency-wide use 
of PIV credentials. Related controls: AU-2, PE-3, SA-4. 
(2) IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION | ACCEPTANCE OF THIRD-PARTY CREDENTIALS 
The information system accepts only FICAM-approved third-party credentials. 
Supplemental Guidance:  This control enhancement typically applies to organizational 
information systems that are accessible to the general public, for example, public-facing 
websites. Third-party credentials are those credentials issued by nonfederal government 
entities approved by the Federal Identity, Credential, and Access Management (FICAM) Trust 
Framework Solutions initiative. Approved third-party credentials meet or exceed the set of 
minimum federal government-wide technical, security, privacy, and organizational maturity 
requirements. This allows federal government relying parties to trust such credentials at their 
approved assurance levels. Related control: AU-2. 
(3) IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION | USE OF FICAM-APPROVED PRODUCTS 
The organization employs only FICAM-approved information system components in [Assignment: 
organization-defined information systems] to accept third-party credentials. 
Supplemental Guidance:  This control enhancement typically applies to information systems that 
are accessible to the general public, for example, public-facing websites. FICAM-approved 
information system components include, for example, information technology products and 
software libraries that have been approved by the Federal Identity, Credential, and Access 
Management conformance program. Related control: SA-4.

Supplemental Guidance:  This control enhancement addresses open identity management 
standards. To ensure that these standards are viable, robust, reliable, sustainable (e.g., 
available in commercial information technology products), and interoperable as documented, 
the United States Government assesses and scopes identity management standards and 
technology implementations against applicable federal legislation, directives, policies, and 
requirements.  The result is FICAM-issued implementation profiles of approved protocols 
(e.g., FICAM authentication protocols such as SAML 2.0 and OpenID 2.0, as well as other 
protocols such as the FICAM Backend Attribute Exchange). Related control: SA-4.  
(5) IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION | ACCEPTANCE OF PIV-I CREDENTIALS 
The information system accepts and electronically verifies Personal Identity Verification-I (PIV-I) 
credentials. 
Supplemental Guidance:  This control enhancement: (i) applies to logical and physical access 
control systems; and (ii) addresses Non-Federal Issuers (NFIs) of identity cards that desire to 
interoperate with United States Government Personal Identity Verification (PIV) information 
systems and that can be trusted by federal government-relying parties. The X.509 certificate 
policy for the Federal Bridge Certification Authority (FBCA) addresses PIV-I requirements. 
The PIV-I card is suitable for Assurance Level 4 as defined in OMB Memorandum 04-04 and 
NIST Special Publication 800-63, and multifactor authentication as defined in NIST Special 
Publication 800-116. PIV-I credentials are those credentials issued by a PIV-I provider whose 
PIV-I certificate policy maps to the Federal Bridge PIV-I Certificate Policy. A PIV-I provider 
is cross-certified (directly or through another PKI bridge) with the FBCA with policies that 
have been mapped and approved as meeting the requirements of the PIV-I policies defined in 
the FBCA certificate policy. Related control: AU-2.

IA-9 SERVICE IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION 
Control:  The organization identifies and authenticates [Assignment: organization-defined 
information system services] using [Assignment: organization-defined security safeguards].  
Supplemental Guidance:  This control supports service-oriented architectures and other distributed 
architectural approaches requiring the identification and authentication of information system 
services. In such architectures, external services often appear dynamically. Therefore, information 
systems should be able to determine in a dynamic manner, if external providers and associated 
services are authentic. Safeguards implemented by organizational information systems to validate 
provider and service authenticity include, for example, information or code signing, provenance 
graphs, and/or electronic signatures indicating or including the sources of services. 
Control Enhancements: 
(1) SERVICE IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION | INFORMATION EXCHANGE  
The organization ensures that service providers receive, validate, and transmit identification and 
authentication information. 
(2) SERVICE IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION | TRANSMISSION OF DECISIONS 
The organization ensures that identification and authentication decisions are transmitted between 
[Assignment: organization-defined services] consistent with organizational policies. 
Supplemental Guidance:  For distributed architectures (e.g., service-oriented architectures), the 
decisions regarding the validation of identification and authentication claims may be made by 
services separate from the services acting on those decisions. In such situations, it is necessary

IA-10 ADAPTIVE IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION 
Control:  The organization requires that individuals accessing the information system employ 
[Assignment: organization-defined supplemental authentication techniques or mechanisms] under 
specific [Assignment: organization-defined circumstances or situations].  
Supplemental Guidance:  Adversaries may compromise individual authentication mechanisms and 
subsequently attempt to impersonate legitimate users. This situation can potentially occur with any 
authentication mechanisms employed by organizations. To address this threat, organizations may 
employ specific techniques/mechanisms and establish protocols to assess suspicious behavior 
(e.g., individuals accessing information that they do not typically access as part of their normal 
duties, roles, or responsibilities, accessing greater quantities of information than the individuals 
would routinely access, or attempting to access information from suspicious network addresses). 
In these situations when certain preestablished conditions or triggers occur, organizations can 
require selected individuals to provide additional authentication information. Another potential use 
for adaptive identification and authentication is to increase the strength of mechanism based on the 
number and/or types of records being accessed. Related controls: AU-6, SI-4.

2. Incident response procedures [Assignment: organization-defined frequency]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  This control addresses the establishment of policy and procedures for the 
effective implementation of selected security controls and control enhancements in the IR family. 
Policy and procedures reflect applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, 
policies, standards, and guidance. Security program policies and procedures at the organization 
level may make the need for system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The policy can 
be included as part of the general information security policy for organizations or conversely, can 
be represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex nature of certain organizations. The 
procedures can be established for the security program in general and for particular information 
systems, if needed. The organizational risk management strategy is a key factor in establishing 
policy and procedures. Related control: PM-9.

IR-4 INCIDENT HANDLING 
Control:  The organization: 
a. Implements an incident handling capability for security incidents that includes preparation, 
detection and analysis, containment, eradication, and recovery; 
b. Coordinates incident handling activities with contingency planning activities; and 
c. Incorporates lessons learned from ongoing incident handling activities into incident response 
procedures, training, and testing/exercises, and implements the resulting changes accordingly. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Organizations recognize that incident response capability is dependent on 
the capabilities of organizational information systems and the mission/business processes being 
supported by those systems. Therefore, organizations consider incident response as part of the 
definition, design, and development of mission/business processes and information systems. 
Incident-related information can be obtained from a variety of sources including, for example, 
audit monitoring, network monitoring, physical access monitoring, user/administrator reports, and 
reported supply chain events. Effective incident handling capability includes coordination among 
many organizational entities including, for example, mission/business owners, information system 
owners, authorizing officials, human resources offices, physical and personnel security offices, 
legal departments, operations personnel, procurement offices, and the risk executive (function). 
Related controls: AU-6, CM-6, CP-2, CP-4, IR-2, IR-3, IR-8, PE-6, SC-5, SC-7, SI-3, SI-4, SI-7. 
Control Enhancements: 
(1) INCIDENT HANDLING | AUTOMATED INCIDENT HANDLING PROCESSES 
The organization employs automated mechanisms to support the incident handling process. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Automated mechanisms supporting incident handling processes 
include, for example, online incident management systems. 
(2) INCIDENT HANDLING | DYNAMIC RECONFIGURATION 
The organization includes dynamic reconfiguration of [Assignment: organization-defined 
information system components] as part of the incident response capability. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Dynamic reconfiguration includes, for example, changes to router 
rules, access control lists, intrusion detection/prevention system parameters, and filter rules 
for firewalls and gateways. Organizations perform dynamic reconfiguration of information 
systems, for example, to stop attacks, to misdirect attackers, and to isolate components of 
systems, thus limiting the extent of the damage from breaches or compromises. Organizations 
include time frames for achieving the reconfiguration of information systems in the definition 
of the reconfiguration capability, considering the potential need for rapid response in order to 
effectively address sophisticated cyber threats. Related controls: AC-2, AC-4, AC-16, CM-2, 
CM-3, CM-4. 
(3) INCIDENT HANDLING | CONTINUITY OF OPERATIONS  
The organization identifies [Assignment: organization-defined classes of incidents] and 
[Assignment: organization-defined actions to take in response to classes of incidents] to ensure 
continuation of organizational missions and business functions.   
Supplemental Guidance:  Classes of incidents include, for example, malfunctions due to 
design/implementation errors and omissions, targeted malicious attacks, and untargeted 
malicious attacks. Appropriate incident response actions include, for example, graceful 
degradation, information system shutdown, fall back to manual mode/alternative technology 
whereby the system operates differently, employing deceptive measures, alternate information 
flows, or operating in a mode that is reserved solely for when systems are under attack. 
(4) INCIDENT HANDLING | INFORMATION CORRELATION 
The organization correlates incident information and individual incident responses to achieve an 
organization-wide perspective on incident awareness and response. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Sometimes the nature of a threat event, for example, a hostile cyber 
attack, is such that it can only be observed by bringing together information from different 
sources including various reports and reporting procedures established by organizations.

system if [Assignment: organization-defined security violations] are detected. 
(6) INCIDENT HANDLING | INSIDER THREATS - SPECIFIC CAPABILITIES 
The organization implements incident handling capability for insider threats. 
Supplemental Guidance:  While many organizations address insider threat incidents as an 
inherent part of their organizational incident response capability, this control enhancement 
provides additional emphasis on this type of threat and the need for specific incident handling 
capabilities (as defined within organizations) to provide appropriate and timely responses. 
(7) INCIDENT HANDLING | INSIDER THREATS - INTRA-ORGANIZATION COORDINATION 
The organization coordinates incident handling capability for insider threats across [Assignment: 
organization-defined components or elements of the organization]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Incident handling for insider threat incidents (including preparation, 
detection and analysis, containment, eradication, and recovery) requires close coordination 
among a variety of organizational components or elements to be effective. These components 
or elements include, for example, mission/business owners, information system owners, 
human resources offices, procurement offices, personnel/physical security offices, operations 
personnel, and risk executive (function). In addition, organizations may require external 
support from federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies. 
(8) INCIDENT HANDLING | CORRELATION WITH EXTERNAL ORGANIZATIONS  
The organization coordinates with [Assignment: organization-defined external organizations] to 
correlate and share [Assignment: organization-defined incident information] to achieve a cross-
organization perspective on incident awareness and more effective incident responses. 
Supplemental Guidance:  The coordination of incident information with external organizations 
including, for example, mission/business partners, military/coalition partners, customers, and 
multitiered developers, can provide significant benefits. Cross-organizational coordination 
with respect to incident handling can serve as an important risk management capability. This 
capability allows organizations to leverage critical information from a variety of sources to 
effectively respond to information security-related incidents potentially affecting the 
organization’s operations, assets, and individuals. 
(9) INCIDENT HANDLING | DYNAMIC RESPONSE CAPABILITY  
The organization employs [Assignment: organization-defined dynamic response capabilities] to 
effectively respond to security incidents. 
Supplemental Guidance:  This control enhancement addresses the deployment of replacement or 
new capabilities in a timely manner in response to security incidents (e.g., adversary actions 
during hostile cyber attacks). This includes capabilities implemented at the mission/business 
process level (e.g., activating alternative mission/business processes) and at the information 
system level. Related control: CP-10. 
(10) INCIDENT HANDLING | SUPPLY CHAIN COORDINATION  
The organization coordinates incident handling activities involving supply chain events with other 
organizations involved in the supply chain.

f. Performing other [Assignment: organization-defined actions]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Information spillage refers to instances where either classified or sensitive 
information is inadvertently placed on information systems that are not authorized to process such 
information. Such information spills often occur when information that is initially thought to be of 
lower sensitivity is transmitted to an information system and then is subsequently determined to be 
of higher sensitivity. At that point, corrective action is required. The nature of the organizational 
response is generally based upon the degree of sensitivity of the spilled information (e.g., security 
category or classification level), the security capabilities of the information system, the specific 
nature of contaminated storage media, and the access authorizations (e.g., security clearances) of 
individuals with authorized access to the contaminated system. The methods used to communicate 
information about the spill after the fact do not involve methods directly associated with the actual 
spill to minimize the risk of further spreading the contamination before such contamination is 
isolated and eradicated. 
Control Enhancements: 
(1) INFORMATION SPILLAGE RESPONSE | RESPONSIBLE PERSONNEL  
The organization assigns [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles] with responsibility 
for responding to information spills. 
(2) INFORMATION SPILLAGE RESPONSE | TRAINING  
The organization provides information spillage response training [Assignment: organization-

(3) INFORMATION SPILLAGE RESPONSE | POST-SPILL OPERATIONS  
The organization implements [Assignment: organization-defined procedures] to ensure that 
organizational personnel impacted by information spills can continue to carry out assigned tasks 
while contaminated systems are undergoing corrective actions. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Correction actions for information systems contaminated due to 
information spillages may be very time-consuming. During those periods, personnel may not 
have access to the contaminated systems, which may potentially affect their ability to conduct 
organizational business. 
(4) INFORMATION SPILLAGE RESPONSE | EXPOSURE TO UNAUTHORIZED PERSONNEL 
The organization employs [Assignment: organization-defined security safeguards] for personnel 
exposed to information not within assigned access authorizations. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Security safeguards include, for example, making personnel exposed 
to spilled information aware of the federal laws, directives, policies, and/or regulations 
regarding the information and the restrictions imposed based on exposure to such information.

IR-10 INTEGRATED INFORMATION SECURITY ANALYSIS TEAM 
Control:  The organization establishes an integrated team of forensic/malicious code analysts, tool 
developers, and real-time operations personnel. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Having an integrated team for incident response facilitates information 
sharing. Such capability allows organizational personnel, including developers, implementers, and 
operators, to leverage the team knowledge of the threat in order to implement defensive measures 
that will enable organizations to deter intrusions more effectively. Moreover, it promotes the rapid 
detection of intrusions, development of appropriate mitigations, and the deployment of effective 
defensive measures. For example, when an intrusion is detected, the integrated security analysis 
team can rapidly develop an appropriate response for operators to implement, correlate the new 
incident with information on past intrusions, and augment ongoing intelligence development. This

 Control:  The organization: 
a. Approves and monitors nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic activities; 
b. Allows the use of nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic tools only as consistent with 
organizational policy and documented in the security plan for the information system; 
c. Employs strong authenticators in the establishment of nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic 
sessions; 
d. Maintains records for nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic activities; and 
e. Terminates session and network connections when nonlocal maintenance is completed.     
Supplemental Guidance:  Nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic activities are those activities 
conducted by individuals communicating through a network, either an external network (e.g., the 
Internet) or an internal network. Local maintenance and diagnostic activities are those activities 
carried out by individuals physically present at the information system or information system 
component and not communicating across a network connection. Authentication techniques used 
in the establishment of nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic sessions reflect the network access 
requirements in IA-2. Typically, strong authentication requires authenticators that are resistant to 
replay attacks and employ multifactor authentication. Strong authenticators include, for example, 
PKI where certificates are stored on a token protected by a password, passphrase, or biometric.

Supplemental Guidance:  This control applies to individuals performing hardware or software 
maintenance on organizational information systems, while PE-2 addresses physical access for 
individuals whose maintenance duties place them within the physical protection perimeter of the 
systems (e.g., custodial staff, physical plant maintenance personnel). Technical competence of 
supervising individuals relates to the maintenance performed on the information systems while 
having required access authorizations refers to maintenance on and near the systems. Individuals 
not previously identified as authorized maintenance personnel, such as information technology 
manufacturers, vendors, systems integrators, and consultants, may require privileged access to 
organizational information systems, for example, when required to conduct maintenance activities 
with little or no notice. Based on organizational assessments of risk, organizations may issue 
temporary credentials to these individuals. Temporary credentials may be for one-time use or for 
very limited time periods. Related controls: AC-2, IA-8, MP-2, PE-2, PE-3, PE-4, RA-3.

Control Enhancements: 
(1) TIMELY MAINTENANCE | PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE 
The organization performs preventive maintenance on [Assignment: organization-defined 
information system components] at [Assignment: organization-defined time intervals]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Preventive maintenance includes proactive care and servicing of 
organizational information systems components for the purpose of maintaining equipment and 
facilities in satisfactory operating condition. Such maintenance provides for the systematic 
inspection, tests, measurements, adjustments, parts replacement, detection, and correction of 
incipient failures either before they occur or before they develop into major defects. The 
primary goal of preventive maintenance is to avoid/mitigate the consequences of equipment 
failures. Preventive maintenance is designed to preserve and restore equipment reliability by 
replacing worn components before they actually fail. Methods of determining what preventive 
(or other) failure management policies to apply include, for example, original equipment 
manufacturer (OEM) recommendations, statistical failure records, requirements of codes, 
legislation, or regulations within a jurisdiction, expert opinion, maintenance that has already 
been conducted on similar equipment, or measured values and performance indications. 
(2) TIMELY MAINTENANCE | PREDICTIVE MAINTENANCE 
The organization performs predictive maintenance on [Assignment: organization-defined 
information system components] at [Assignment: organization-defined time intervals]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Predictive maintenance, or condition-based maintenance, attempts to 
evaluate the condition of equipment by performing periodic or continuous (online) equipment 
condition monitoring. The goal of predictive maintenance is to perform maintenance at a 
scheduled point in time when the maintenance activity is most cost-effective and before the 
equipment loses performance within a threshold. The predictive component of predictive 
maintenance stems from the goal of predicting the future trend of the equipment's condition. 
This approach uses principles of statistical process control to determine at what point in the 
future maintenance activities will be appropriate. Most predictive maintenance inspections are 
performed while equipment is in service, thereby minimizing disruption of normal system 
operations. Predictive maintenance can result in substantial cost savings and higher system 
reliability. Predictive maintenance tends to include measurement of the item. To evaluate 
equipment condition, predictive maintenance utilizes nondestructive testing technologies such 
as infrared, acoustic (partial discharge and airborne ultrasonic), corona detection, vibration 
analysis, sound level measurements, oil analysis, and other specific online tests. 
(3) TIMELY MAINTENANCE | AUTOMATED SUPPORT FOR PREDICTIVE MAINTENANCE 
The organization employs automated mechanisms to transfer predictive maintenance data to a 
computerized maintenance management system. 
Supplemental Guidance:  A computerized maintenance management system maintains a 
computer database of information about the maintenance operations of organizations and 
automates processing equipment condition data in order to trigger maintenance planning, 
execution, and reporting.

MP-5 MEDIA TRANSPORT 
Control:  The organization: 
a. Protects and controls [Assignment: organization-defined types of information system media] 
during transport outside of controlled areas using [Assignment: organization-defined security 
safeguards]; 
b. Maintains accountability for information system media during transport outside of controlled 
areas; 
c. Documents activities associated with the transport of information system media; and 
d. Restricts the activities associated with the transport of information system media to authorized 
personnel. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Information system media includes both digital and non-digital media. 
Digital media includes, for example, diskettes, magnetic tapes, external/removable hard disk 
drives, flash drives, compact disks, and digital video disks. Non-digital media includes, for 
example, paper and microfilm. This control also applies to mobile devices with information 
storage capability (e.g., smart phones, tablets, E-readers), that are transported outside of controlled 
areas. Controlled areas are areas or spaces for which organizations provide sufficient physical 
and/or procedural safeguards to meet the requirements established for protecting information 
and/or information systems.   
Physical and technical safeguards for media are commensurate with the security category or 
classification of the information residing on the media. Safeguards to protect media during 
transport include, for example, locked containers and cryptography. Cryptographic mechanisms 
can provide confidentiality and integrity protections depending upon the mechanisms used. 
Activities associated with transport include the actual transport as well as those activities such as 
releasing media for transport and ensuring that media enters the appropriate transport processes. 
For the actual transport, authorized transport and courier personnel may include individuals from 
outside the organization (e.g., U.S. Postal Service or a commercial transport or delivery service). 
Maintaining accountability of media during transport includes, for example, restricting transport 
activities to authorized personnel, and tracking and/or obtaining explicit records of transport 
activities as the media moves through the transportation system to prevent and detect loss,

destruction, or tampering. Organizations establish documentation requirements for activities 
associated with the transport of information system media in accordance with organizational 
assessments of risk to include the flexibility to define different record-keeping methods for the 
different types of media transport as part of an overall system of transport-related records. Related 
controls: AC-19, CP-9, MP-3, MP-4, RA-3, SC-8, SC-13, SC-28. 
Control Enhancements: 
(1) MEDIA TRANSPORT | PROTECTION OUTSIDE OF CONTROLLED AREAS 
[Withdrawn: Incorporated into MP-5]. 
(2) MEDIA TRANSPORT | DOCUMENTATION OF ACTIVITIES  
[Withdrawn: Incorporated into MP-5]. 
(3) MEDIA TRANSPORT | CUSTODIANS  
The organization employs an identified custodian during transport of information system media 
outside of controlled areas. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Identified custodians provide organizations with specific points of 
contact during the media transport process and facilitate individual accountability. Custodial 
responsibilities can be transferred from one individual to another as long as an unambiguous 
custodian is identified at all times. 
(4) MEDIA TRANSPORT | CRYPTOGRAPHIC PROTECTION  
The information system implements cryptographic mechanisms to protect the confidentiality and 
integrity of information stored on digital media during transport outside of controlled areas. 
Supplemental Guidance:  This control enhancement applies to both portable storage devices 
(e.g., USB memory sticks, compact disks, digital video disks, external/removable hard disk 
drives) and mobile devices with storage capability (e.g., smart phones, tablets, E-readers).

MP-6 MEDIA SANITIZATION 
Control:  The organization: 
a. Sanitizes [Assignment: organization-defined information system media] prior to disposal, 
release out of organizational control, or release for reuse using [Assignment: organization-
defined sanitization techniques and procedures] in accordance with applicable federal and 
organizational standards and policies; and 
b. Employs sanitization mechanisms with the strength and integrity commensurate with the 
security category or classification of the information. 
Supplemental Guidance:   This control applies to all information system media, both digital and non-
digital, subject to disposal or reuse, whether or not the media is considered removable. Examples 
include media found in scanners, copiers, printers, notebook computers, workstations, network 
components, and mobile devices. The sanitization process removes information from the media 
such that the information cannot be retrieved or reconstructed. Sanitization techniques, including 
clearing, purging, cryptographic erase, and destruction, prevent the disclosure of information to 
unauthorized individuals when such media is reused or released for disposal. Organizations 
determine the appropriate sanitization methods recognizing that destruction is sometimes 
necessary when other methods cannot be applied to media requiring sanitization. Organizations 
use discretion on the employment of approved sanitization techniques and procedures for media 
containing information deemed to be in the public domain or publicly releasable, or deemed to 
have no adverse impact on organizations or individuals if released for reuse or disposal.

APPENDIX F-MP   PAGE F-123 
Sanitization of non-digital media includes, for example, removing a classified appendix from an 
otherwise unclassified document, or redacting selected sections or words from a document by 
obscuring the redacted sections/words in a manner equivalent in effectiveness to removing them 
from the document. NSA standards and policies control the sanitization process for media 
containing classified information. Related controls: MA-2, MA-4, RA-3, SC-4. 
Control Enhancements: 
(1) MEDIA SANITIZATION | REVIEW / APPROVE / TRACK / DOCUMENT / VERIFY  
The organization reviews, approves, tracks, documents, and verifies media sanitization and 
disposal actions. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Organizations review and approve media to be sanitized to ensure 
compliance with records-retention policies. Tracking/documenting actions include, for 
example, listing personnel who reviewed and approved sanitization and disposal actions, 
types of media sanitized, specific files stored on the media, sanitization methods used, date 
and time of the sanitization actions, personnel who performed the sanitization, verification 
actions taken, personnel who performed the verification, and disposal action taken. 
Organizations verify that the sanitization of the media was effective prior to disposal. Related 
control: SI-12. 
(2) MEDIA SANITIZATION | EQUIPMENT TESTING  
The organization tests sanitization equipment and procedures [Assignment: organization-defined 
frequency] to verify that the intended sanitization is being achieved. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Testing of sanitization equipment and procedures may be conducted by 
qualified and authorized external entities (e.g., other federal agencies or external service 
providers). 
(3) MEDIA SANITIZATION | NONDESTRUCTIVE TECHNIQUES  
The organization applies nondestructive sanitization techniques to portable storage devices prior 
to connecting such devices to the information system under the following circumstances: 
[Assignment: organization-defined circumstances requiring sanitization of portable storage 
devices]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  This control enhancement applies to digital media containing classified 
information and Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI). Portable storage devices can be 
the source of malicious code insertions into organizational information systems. Many of 
these devices are obtained from unknown and potentially untrustworthy sources and may 
contain malicious code that can be readily transferred to information systems through USB 
ports or other entry portals. While scanning such storage devices is always recommended, 
sanitization provides additional assurance that the devices are free of malicious code to 
include code capable of initiating zero-day attacks. Organizations consider nondestructive 
sanitization of portable storage devices when such devices are first purchased from the 
manufacturer or vendor prior to initial use or when organizations lose a positive chain of 
custody for the devices. Related control: SI-3.

(6) MEDIA SANITIZATION | MEDIA DESTRUCTION 
[Withdrawn: Incorporated into MP-6]. 
(7) MEDIA SANITIZATION | DUAL AUTHORIZATION  
The organization enforces dual authorization for the sanitization of [Assignment: organization-
defined information system media]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Organizations employ dual authorization to ensure that information 
system media sanitization cannot occur unless two technically qualified individuals conduct 
the task. Individuals sanitizing information system media possess sufficient skills/expertise to 
determine if the proposed sanitization reflects applicable federal/organizational standards, 
policies, and procedures. Dual authorization also helps to ensure that sanitization occurs as

intended, both protecting against errors and false claims of having performed the sanitization 
actions. Related controls: AC-3, MP-2. 
(8) MEDIA SANITIZATION | REMOTE PURGING / WIPING OF INFORMATION 
The organization provides the capability to purge/wipe information from [Assignment: 
organization-defined information systems, system components, or devices] either remotely or 
under the following conditions: [Assignment: organization-defined conditions]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  This control enhancement protects data/information on organizational 
information systems, system components, or devices (e.g., mobile devices) if such systems, 
components, or devices are obtained by unauthorized individuals. Remote purge/wipe 
commands require strong authentication to mitigate the risk of unauthorized individuals 
purging/wiping the system/component/device. The purge/wipe function can be implemented 
in a variety of ways including, for example, by overwriting data/information multiple times or 
by destroying the key necessary to decrypt encrypted data.

MP-7 MEDIA USE 
Control:  The organization [Selection: restricts; prohibits] the use of [Assignment: organization-
defined types of information system media] on [Assignment: organization-defined information 
systems or system components] using [Assignment: organization-defined security safeguards]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Information system media includes both digital and non-digital media. 
Digital media includes, for example, diskettes, magnetic tapes, external/removable hard disk 
drives, flash drives, compact disks, and digital video disks. Non-digital media includes, for 
example, paper and microfilm. This control also applies to mobile devices with information 
storage capability (e.g., smart phones, tablets, E-readers). In contrast to MP-2, which restricts user 
access to media, this control restricts the use of certain types of media on information systems, for 
example, restricting/prohibiting the use of flash drives or external hard disk drives. Organizations 
can employ technical and nontechnical safeguards (e.g., policies, procedures, rules of behavior) to 
restrict the use of information system media. Organizations may restrict the use of portable storage 
devices, for example, by using physical cages on workstations to prohibit access to certain external 
ports, or disabling/removing the ability to insert, read or write to such devices. Organizations may 
also limit the use of portable storage devices to only approved devices including, for example, 
devices provided by the organization, devices provided by other approved organizations, and 
devices that are not personally owned. Finally, organizations may restrict the use of portable 
storage devices based on the type of device, for example, prohibiting the use of writeable, portable 
storage devices, and implementing this restriction by disabling or removing the capability to write 
to such devices. Related controls: AC-19, PL-4. 
Control Enhancements: 
(1) MEDIA USE | PROHIBIT USE WITHOUT OWNER  
The organization prohibits the use of portable storage devices in organizational information 
systems when such devices have no identifiable owner. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Requiring identifiable owners (e.g., individuals, organizations, or 
projects) for portable storage devices reduces the risk of using such technologies by allowing 
organizations to assign responsibility and accountability for addressing known vulnerabilities 
in the devices (e.g., malicious code insertion). Related control: PL-4. 
(2) MEDIA USE | PROHIBIT USE OF SANITIZATION-RESISTANT MEDIA  
The organization prohibits the use of sanitization-resistant media in organizational information 
systems.

Supplemental Guidance:  Sanitation-resistance applies to the capability to purge information 
from media. Certain types of media do not support sanitize commands, or if supported, the 
interfaces are not supported in a standardized way across these devices. Sanitation-resistant 
media include, for example, compact flash, embedded flash on boards and devices, solid state 
drives, and USB removable media. Related control: MP-6.

MP-8 MEDIA DOWNGRADING 
Control:  The organization: 
a. Establishes [Assignment: organization-defined information system media downgrading 
process] that includes employing downgrading mechanisms with [Assignment: organization-
defined strength and integrity]; 
b. Ensures that the information system media downgrading process is commensurate with the 
security category and/or classification level of the information to be removed and the access 
authorizations of the potential recipients of the downgraded information; 
c. Identifies [Assignment: organization-defined information system media requiring 
downgrading]; and 
d. Downgrades the identified information system media using the established process. 
Supplemental Guidance:  This control applies to all information system media, digital and non-
digital, subject to release outside of the organization, whether or not the media is considered 
removable. The downgrading process, when applied to system media, removes information from 
the media, typically by security category or classification level, such that the information cannot 
be retrieved or reconstructed. Downgrading of media includes redacting information to enable 
wider release and distribution. Downgrading of media also ensures that empty space on the media 
(e.g., slack space within files) is devoid of information. 
Control Enhancements: 
(1) MEDIA DOWNGRADING  | DOCUMENTATION OF PROCESS 
The organization documents information system media downgrading actions. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Organizations can document the media downgrading process by 
providing information such as the downgrading technique employed, the identification 
number of the downgraded media, and the identity of the individual that authorized and/or 
performed the downgrading action. 
(2) MEDIA DOWNGRADING  | EQUIPMENT TESTING  
The organization employs [Assignment: organization-defined tests] of downgrading equipment and 
procedures to verify correct performance [Assignment: organization-defined frequency]. 
(3) MEDIA DOWNGRADING  | CONTROLLED UNCLASSIFIED INFORMATION  
The organization downgrades information system media containing [Assignment: organization-
defined Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI)] prior to public release in accordance with 
applicable federal and organizational standards and policies. 
(4) MEDIA DOWNGRADING  | CLASSIFIED INFORMATION 
The organization downgrades information system media containing classified information prior to 
release to individuals without required access authorizations in accordance with NSA standards 
and policies.

Supplemental Guidance:  This control addresses the establishment of policy and procedures for the 
effective implementation of selected security controls and control enhancements in the PE family. 
Policy and procedures reflect applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, 
policies, standards, and guidance. Security program policies and procedures at the organization 
level may make the need for system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The policy can 
be included as part of the general information security policy for organizations or conversely, can 
be represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex nature of certain organizations. The 
procedures can be established for the security program in general and for particular information 
systems, if needed. The organizational risk management strategy is a key factor in establishing 
policy and procedures. Related control: PM-9.

g. Changes combinations and keys [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] and/or when 
keys are lost, combinations are compromised, or individuals are transferred or terminated. 
Supplemental Guidance:  This control applies to organizational employees and visitors. Individuals 
(e.g., employees, contractors, and others) with permanent physical access authorization credentials 
are not considered visitors. Organizations determine the types of facility guards needed including, 
for example, professional physical security staff or other personnel such as administrative staff or 
information system users. Physical access devices include, for example, keys, locks, combinations, 
and card readers. Safeguards for publicly accessible areas within organizational facilities include, 
for example, cameras, monitoring by guards, and isolating selected information systems and/or 
system components in secured areas. Physical access control systems comply with applicable 
federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance. The 
Federal Identity, Credential, and Access Management Program provides implementation guidance 
for identity, credential, and access management capabilities for physical access control systems. 
Organizations have flexibility in the types of audit logs employed. Audit logs can be procedural 
(e.g., a written log of individuals accessing the facility and when such access occurred), automated 
(e.g., capturing ID provided by a PIV card), or some combination thereof. Physical access points 
can include facility access points, interior access points to information systems and/or components 
requiring supplemental access controls, or both. Components of organizational information 
systems (e.g., workstations, terminals) may be located in areas designated as publicly accessible 
with organizations safeguarding access to such devices. Related controls: AU-2, AU-6, MP-2,

plan implementation; 
b. Distributes copies of the security plan and communicates subsequent changes to the plan to 
[Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles]; 
c. Reviews the security plan for the information system [Assignment: organization-defined 
frequency];  
d. Updates the plan to address changes to the information system/environment of operation or 
problems identified during plan implementation or security control assessments; and 
e. Protects the security plan from unauthorized disclosure and modification. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Security plans relate security requirements to a set of security controls and 
control enhancements. Security plans also describe, at a high level, how the security controls and 
control enhancements meet those security requirements, but do not provide detailed, technical 
descriptions of the specific design or implementation of the controls/enhancements. Security plans 
contain sufficient information (including the specification of parameter values for assignment and 
selection statements either explicitly or by reference) to enable a design and implementation that is 
unambiguously compliant with the intent of the plans and subsequent determinations of risk to 
organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation if the plan is 
implemented as intended. Organizations can also apply tailoring guidance to the security control 
baselines in Appendix D and CNSS Instruction 1253 to develop overlays for community-wide use 
or to address specialized requirements, technologies, or missions/environments of operation (e.g., 
DoD-tactical, Federal Public Key Infrastructure, or Federal Identity, Credential, and Access 
Management, space operations). Appendix I provides guidance on developing overlays. 
Security plans need not be single documents; the plans can be a collection of various documents 
including documents that already exist. Effective security plans make extensive use of references 
to policies, procedures, and additional documents (e.g., design and implementation specifications) 
where more detailed information can be obtained. This reduces the documentation requirements 
associated with security programs and maintains security-related information in other established 
management/operational areas related to enterprise architecture, system development life cycle, 
systems engineering, and acquisition. For example, security plans do not contain detailed 
contingency plan or incident response plan information but instead provide explicitly or by 
reference, sufficient information to define what needs to be accomplished by those plans. Related

PL-4 RULES OF BEHAVIOR 
 Control:  The organization: 
a. Establishes and makes readily available to individuals requiring access to the information 
system, the rules that describe their responsibilities and expected behavior with regard to 
information and information system usage; 
b. Receives a signed acknowledgment from such individuals, indicating that they have read, 
understand, and agree to abide by the rules of behavior, before authorizing access to 
information and the information system; 
c. Reviews and updates the rules of behavior [Assignment: organization-defined frequency]; and 
d. Requires individuals who have signed a previous version of the rules of behavior to read and 
resign when the rules of behavior are revised/updated. 
Supplemental Guidance:  This control enhancement applies to organizational users. Organizations 
consider rules of behavior based on individual user roles and responsibilities, differentiating, for 
example, between rules that apply to privileged users and rules that apply to general users. 
Establishing rules of behavior for some types of non-organizational users including, for example, 
individuals who simply receive data/information from federal information systems, is often not 
feasible given the large number of such users and the limited nature of their interactions with the 
systems. Rules of behavior for both organizational and non-organizational users can also be 
established in AC-8, System Use Notification. PL-4 b. (the signed acknowledgment portion of this 
control) may be satisfied by the security awareness training and role-based security training 
programs conducted by organizations if such training includes rules of behavior. Organizations 
can use electronic signatures for acknowledging rules of behavior. Related controls: AC-2, AC-6,

Control Enhancements: 
(1) RULES OF BEHAVIOR | SOCIAL MEDIA AND NETWORKING RESTRICTIONS  
The organization includes in the rules of behavior, explicit restrictions on the use of social 
media/networking sites and posting organizational information on public websites. 
Supplemental Guidance:  This control enhancement addresses rules of behavior related to the 
use of social media/networking sites: (i) when organizational personnel are using such sites 
for official duties or in the conduct of official business; (ii) when organizational information 
is involved in social media/networking transactions; and (iii) when personnel are accessing 
social media/networking sites from organizational information systems. Organizations also 
address specific rules that prevent unauthorized entities from obtaining and/or inferring non-
public organizational information (e.g., system account information, personally identifiable 
information) from social media/networking sites.

APPENDIX F-PL   PAGE F-143 
Supplemental Guidance:  This control addresses actions taken by organizations in the design and 
development of information systems. The information security architecture at the individual 
information system level is consistent with and complements the more global, organization-wide 
information security architecture described in PM-7 that is integral to and developed as part of the 
enterprise architecture. The information security architecture includes an architectural description, 
the placement/allocation of security functionality (including security controls), security-related 
information for external interfaces, information being exchanged across the interfaces, and the 
protection mechanisms associated with each interface. In addition, the security architecture can 
include other important security-related information, for example, user roles and access privileges 
assigned to each role, unique security requirements, the types of information processed, stored, 
and transmitted by the information system, restoration priorities of information and information 
system services, and any other specific protection needs. 
In today’s modern architecture, it is becoming less common for organizations to control all 
information resources. There are going to be key dependencies on external information services 
and service providers. Describing such dependencies in the information security architecture is 
important to developing a comprehensive mission/business protection strategy. Establishing, 
developing, documenting, and maintaining under configuration control, a baseline configuration 
for organizational information systems is critical to implementing and maintaining an effective 
information security architecture. The development of the information security architecture is 
coordinated with the Senior Agency Official for Privacy (SAOP)/Chief Privacy Officer (CPO) to 
ensure that security controls needed to support privacy requirements are identified and effectively 
implemented. PL-8 is primarily directed at organizations (i.e., internally focused) to help ensure 
that organizations develop an information security architecture for the information system, and 
that the security architecture is integrated with or tightly coupled to the enterprise architecture 
through the organization-wide information security architecture. In contrast, SA-17 is primarily 
directed at external information technology product/system developers and integrators (although 
SA-17 could be used internally within organizations for in-house system development). SA-17, 
which is complementary to PL-8, is selected when organizations outsource the development of 
information systems or information system components to external entities, and there is a need to 
demonstrate/show consistency with the organization’s enterprise architecture and information 
security architecture. Related controls: CM-2, CM-6, PL-2, PM-7, SA-5, SA-17, Appendix J. 
Control Enhancements: 
(1) INFORMATION SECURITY ARCHITECTURE | DEFENSE-IN-DEPTH  
The organization designs its security architecture using a defense-in-depth approach that: 
(a) Allocates [Assignment: organization-defined security safeguards] to [Assignment: 
organization-defined locations and architectural layers]; and 
(b) Ensures that the allocated security safeguards operate in a coordinated and mutually 
reinforcing manner. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Organizations strategically allocate security safeguards (procedural, 
technical, or both) in the security architecture so that adversaries have to overcome multiple 
safeguards to achieve their objective. Requiring adversaries to defeat multiple mechanisms 
makes it more difficult to successfully attack critical information resources (i.e., increases 
adversary work factor) and also increases the likelihood of detection. The coordination of 
allocated safeguards is essential to ensure that an attack that involves one safeguard does not 
create adverse unintended consequences (e.g., lockout, cascading alarms) by interfering with 
another safeguard. Placement of security safeguards is a key activity. Greater asset criticality 
or information value merits additional layering. Thus, an organization may choose to place 
anti-virus software at organizational boundary layers, email/web servers, notebook computers, 
and workstations to maximize the number of related safeguards adversaries must penetrate 
before compromising the information and information systems. Related controls: SC-29, SC-
36.

(2) INFORMATION SECURITY ARCHITECTURE | SUPPLIER DIVERSITY  
The organization requires that [Assignment: organization-defined security safeguards] allocated to 
[Assignment: organization-defined locations and architectural layers] are obtained from different 
suppliers. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Different information technology products have different strengths and 
weaknesses. Providing a broad spectrum of products complements the individual offerings. 
For example, vendors offering malicious code protection typically update their products at 
different times, often developing solutions for known viruses, Trojans, or worms according to 
their priorities and development schedules. By having different products at different locations 
(e.g., server, boundary, desktop) there is an increased likelihood that at least one will detect 
the malicious code. Related control: SA-12.

PL-9 CENTRAL MANAGEMENT 
 Control:  The organization centrally manages [Assignment: organization-defined security controls 
and related processes]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Central management refers to the organization-wide management and 
implementation of selected security controls and related processes. Central management includes 
planning, implementing, assessing, authorizing, and monitoring the organization-defined, centrally 
managed security controls and processes. As central management of security controls is generally 
associated with common controls, such management promotes and facilitates standardization of 
security control implementations and management and judicious use of organizational resources.  
Centrally-managed security controls and processes may also meet independence requirements for 
assessments in support of initial and ongoing authorizations to operate as part of organizational 
continuous monitoring. As part of the security control selection process, organizations determine 
which controls may be suitable for central management based on organizational resources and 
capabilities. Organizations consider that it may not always be possible to centrally manage every 
aspect of a security control. In such cases, the security control is treated as a hybrid control with 
the control managed and implemented either centrally or at the information system level. Controls 
and control enhancements that are candidates for full or partial central management include, but 
are not limited to: AC-2 (1) (2) (3) (4); AC-17 (1) (2) (3) (9); AC-18 (1) (3) (4) (5); AC-19 (4) (6)

be included as part of the general information security policy for organizations or conversely, can 
be represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex nature of certain organizations. The 
procedures can be established for the security program in general and for particular information 
systems, if needed. The organizational risk management strategy is a key factor in establishing 
policy and procedures. Related control: PM-9.

d. Retrieves all security-related organizational information system-related property; 
e. Retains access to organizational information and information systems formerly controlled by 
terminated individual; and 
f. Notifies [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles] within [Assignment: 
organization-defined time period]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Information system-related property includes, for example, hardware 
authentication tokens, system administration technical manuals, keys, identification cards, and 
building passes. Exit interviews ensure that terminated individuals understand the security 
constraints imposed by being former employees and that proper accountability is achieved for 
information system-related property. Security topics of interest at exit interviews can include, for 
example, reminding terminated individuals of nondisclosure agreements and potential limitations 
on future employment. Exit interviews may not be possible for some terminated individuals, for 
example, in cases related to job abandonment, illnesses, and nonavailability of supervisors. Exit 
interviews are important for individuals with security clearances. Timely execution of termination 
actions is essential for individuals terminated for cause. In certain situations, organizations 
consider disabling the information system accounts of individuals that are being terminated prior 
to the individuals being notified. Related controls: AC-2, IA-4, PE-2, PS-5, PS-6. 
Control Enhancements: 
(1) PERSONNEL TERMINATION | POST-EMPLOYMENT REQUIREMENTS 
The organization: 
(a) Notifies terminated individuals of applicable, legally binding post-employment requirements 
for the protection of organizational information; and 
(b) Requires terminated individuals to sign an acknowledgment of post-employment 
requirements as part of the organizational termination process. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Organizations consult with the Office of the General Counsel 
regarding matters of post-employment requirements on terminated individuals. 
(2) PERSONNEL TERMINATION | AUTOMATED NOTIFICATION 
The organization employs automated mechanisms to notify [Assignment: organization-defined 
personnel or roles] upon termination of an individual. 
Supplemental Guidance:  In organizations with a large number of employees, not all personnel 
who need to know about termination actions receive the appropriate notifications—or, if such 
notifications are received, they may not occur in a timely manner. Automated mechanisms 
can be used to send automatic alerts or notifications to specific organizational personnel or 
roles (e.g., management personnel, supervisors, personnel security officers, information 
security officers, systems administrators, or information technology administrators) when 
individuals are terminated. Such automatic alerts or notifications can be conveyed in a variety 
of ways, including, for example, telephonically, via electronic mail, via text message, or via 
websites.

Supplemental Guidance:  This control addresses the establishment of policy and procedures for the 
effective implementation of selected security controls and control enhancements in the RA family. 
Policy and procedures reflect applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, 
policies, standards, and guidance. Security program policies and procedures at the organization 
level may make the need for system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The policy can 
be included as part of the general information security policy for organizations or conversely, can 
be represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex nature of certain organizations. The 
procedures can be established for the security program in general and for particular information 
systems, if needed. The organizational risk management strategy is a key factor in establishing 
policy and procedures. Related control: PM-9.

RA-2 SECURITY CATEGORIZATION  
Control:  The organization: 
a. Categorizes information and the information system in accordance with applicable federal 
laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance; 
b. Documents the security categorization results (including supporting rationale) in the security 
plan for the information system; and 
c. Ensures that the security categorization decision is reviewed and approved by the authorizing 
official or authorizing official designated representative. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Clearly defined authorization boundaries are a prerequisite for effective 
security categorization decisions. Security categories describe the potential adverse impacts to 
organizational operations, organizational assets, and individuals if organizational information and 
information systems are comprised through a loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability. 
Organizations conduct the security categorization process as an organization-wide activity with 
the involvement of chief information officers, senior information security officers, information 
system owners, mission/business owners, and information owners/stewards. Organizations also

RA-3 RISK ASSESSMENT 
Control:  The organization: 
a. Conducts an assessment of risk, including the likelihood and magnitude of harm, from the 
unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction of the 
information system and the information it processes, stores, or transmits; 
b. Documents risk assessment results in [Selection: security plan; risk assessment report; 
[Assignment: organization-defined document]]; 
c. Reviews risk assessment results [Assignment: organization-defined frequency]; 
d. Disseminates risk assessment results to [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or 
roles]; and 
e. Updates the risk assessment [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] or whenever there 
are significant changes to the information system or environment of operation (including the 
identification of new threats and vulnerabilities), or other conditions that may impact the 
security state of the system. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Clearly defined authorization boundaries are a prerequisite for effective 
risk assessments. Risk assessments take into account threats, vulnerabilities, likelihood, and 
impact to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation 
based on the operation and use of information systems. Risk assessments also take into account 
risk from external parties (e.g., service providers, contractors operating information systems on 
behalf of the organization, individuals accessing organizational information systems, outsourcing 
entities). In accordance with OMB policy and related E-authentication initiatives, authentication of 
public users accessing federal information systems may also be required to protect nonpublic or 
privacy-related information. As such, organizational assessments of risk also address public access 
to federal information systems. 
Risk assessments (either formal or informal) can be conducted at all three tiers in the risk 
management hierarchy (i.e., organization level, mission/business process level, or information 
system level) and at any phase in the system development life cycle. Risk assessments can also be 
conducted at various steps in the Risk Management Framework, including categorization, security 
control selection, security control implementation, security control assessment, information 
system authorization, and security control monitoring. RA-3 is noteworthy in that the control must 
be partially implemented prior to the implementation of other controls in order to complete the 
first two steps in the Risk Management Framework. Risk assessments can play an important role 
in security control selection processes, particularly during the application of tailoring guidance, 
which includes security control supplementation. Related controls: RA-2, PM-9.

RA-5 VULNERABILITY SCANNING  
Control:  The organization: 
a. Scans for vulnerabilities in the information system and hosted applications [Assignment: 
organization-defined frequency and/or randomly in accordance with organization-defined 
process] and when new vulnerabilities potentially affecting the system/applications are 
identified and reported; 
b. Employs vulnerability scanning tools and techniques that facilitate interoperability among 
tools and automate parts of the vulnerability management process by using standards for: 
1. Enumerating platforms, software flaws, and improper configurations; 
2. Formatting checklists and test procedures; and 
3. Measuring vulnerability impact;  
c. Analyzes vulnerability scan reports and results from security control assessments; 
d. Remediates legitimate vulnerabilities [Assignment: organization-defined response times] in 
accordance with an organizational assessment of risk; and 
e. Shares information obtained from the vulnerability scanning process and security control 
assessments with [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles] to help eliminate 
similar vulnerabilities in other information systems (i.e., systemic weaknesses or 
deficiencies). 
Supplemental Guidance:  Security categorization of information systems guides the frequency and 
comprehensiveness of vulnerability scans. Organizations determine the required vulnerability 
scanning for all information system components, ensuring that potential sources of vulnerabilities 
such as networked printers, scanners, and copiers are not overlooked. Vulnerability analyses for 
custom software applications may require additional approaches such as static analysis, dynamic 
analysis, binary analysis, or a hybrid of the three approaches. Organizations can employ these 
analysis approaches in a variety of tools (e.g., web-based application scanners, static analysis 
tools, binary analyzers) and in source code reviews. Vulnerability scanning includes, for example: 
(i) scanning for patch levels; (ii) scanning for functions, ports, protocols, and services that should 
not be accessible to users or devices; and (iii) scanning for improperly configured or incorrectly 
operating information flow control mechanisms. Organizations consider using tools that express 
vulnerabilities in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) naming convention and that 
use the Open Vulnerability Assessment Language (OVAL) to determine/test for the presence of 
vulnerabilities. Suggested sources for vulnerability information include the Common Weakness 
Enumeration (CWE) listing and the National Vulnerability Database (NVD). In addition, security 
control assessments such as red team exercises provide other sources of potential vulnerabilities 
for which to scan. Organizations also consider using tools that express vulnerability impact by the

Control Enhancements: 
(1) VULNERABILITY SCANNING | UPDATE TOOL CAPABILITY 
The organization employs vulnerability scanning tools that include the capability to readily update 
the information system vulnerabilities to be scanned. 
Supplemental Guidance:  The vulnerabilities to be scanned need to be readily updated as new 
vulnerabilities are discovered, announced, and scanning methods developed. This updating 
process helps to ensure that potential vulnerabilities in the information system are identified 
and addressed as quickly as possible. Related controls: SI-3, SI-7. 
(2) VULNERABILITY SCANNING | UPDATE BY FREQUENCY / PRIOR TO NEW SCAN / WHEN IDENTIFIED 
The organization updates the information system vulnerabilities scanned [Selection (one or more): 
[Assignment: organization-defined frequency]; prior to a new scan; when new vulnerabilities are 
identified and reported]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Related controls: SI-3, SI-5. 
(3) VULNERABILITY SCANNING | BREADTH / DEPTH OF COVERAGE  
The organization employs vulnerability scanning procedures that can identify the breadth and 
depth of coverage (i.e., information system components scanned and vulnerabilities checked). 
(4) VULNERABILITY SCANNING | DISCOVERABLE INFORMATION  
The organization determines what information about the information system is discoverable by 
adversaries and subsequently takes [Assignment: organization-defined corrective actions]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Discoverable information includes information that adversaries could 
obtain without directly compromising or breaching the information system, for example, by 
collecting information the system is exposing or by conducting extensive searches of the web. 
Corrective actions can include, for example, notifying appropriate organizational personnel, 
removing designated information, or changing the information system to make designated 
information less relevant or attractive to adversaries. Related control: AU-13. 
(5) VULNERABILITY SCANNING | PRIVILEGED ACCESS  
The information system implements privileged access authorization to [Assignment: organization-
identified information system components] for selected [Assignment: organization-defined 
vulnerability scanning activities]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  In certain situations, the nature of the vulnerability scanning may be 
more intrusive or the information system component that is the subject of the scanning may 
contain highly sensitive information. Privileged access authorization to selected system 
components facilitates more thorough vulnerability scanning and also protects the sensitive 
nature of such scanning. 
(6) VULNERABILITY SCANNING | AUTOMATED TREND ANALYSES  
The organization employs automated mechanisms to compare the results of vulnerability scans 
over time to determine trends in information system vulnerabilities. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Related controls: IR-4, IR-5, SI-4. 
(7) VULNERABILITY SCANNING | AUTOMATED DETECTION AND NOTIFICATION OF UNAUTHORIZED COMPONENTS

Supplemental Guidance:  Technical surveillance countermeasures surveys are performed by qualified 
personnel to detect the presence of technical surveillance devices/hazards and to identify technical 
security weaknesses that could aid in the conduct of technical penetrations of surveyed facilities. 
Such surveys provide evaluations of the technical security postures of organizations and facilities 
and typically include thorough visual, electronic, and physical examinations in and about surveyed 
facilities. The surveys also provide useful input into risk assessments and organizational exposure 
to potential adversaries.

SA-3 SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT LIFE CYCLE 
 Control:  The organization: 
a. Manages the information system using [Assignment: organization-defined system 
development life cycle] that incorporates information security considerations; 
b. Defines and documents information security roles and responsibilities throughout the system 
development life cycle; 
c. Identifies individuals having information security roles and responsibilities; and 
d. Integrates the organizational information security risk management process into system 
development life cycle activities. 
Supplemental Guidance:  A well-defined system development life cycle provides the foundation for 
the successful development, implementation, and operation of organizational information systems. 
To apply the required security controls within the system development life cycle requires a basic 
understanding of information security, threats, vulnerabilities, adverse impacts, and risk to critical 
missions/business functions. The security engineering principles in SA-8 cannot be properly 
applied if individuals that design, code, and test information systems and system components 
(including information technology products) do not understand security. Therefore, organizations 
include qualified personnel, for example, chief information security officers, security architects, 
security engineers, and information system security officers in system development life cycle 
activities to ensure that security requirements are incorporated into organizational information 
systems. It is equally important that developers include individuals on the development team that 
possess the requisite security expertise and skills to ensure that needed security capabilities are 
effectively integrated into the information system. Security awareness and training programs can 
help ensure that individuals having key security roles and responsibilities have the appropriate 
experience, skills, and expertise to conduct assigned system development life cycle activities. The 
effective integration of security requirements into enterprise architecture also helps to ensure that 
important security considerations are addressed early in the system development life cycle and that 
those considerations are directly related to the organizational mission/business processes. This 
process also facilitates the integration of the information security architecture into the enterprise 
architecture, consistent with organizational risk management and information security strategies.

d. Security-related documentation requirements; 
e. Requirements for protecting security-related documentation; 
f. Description of the information system development environment and environment in which 
the system is intended to operate; and 
g. Acceptance criteria. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Information system components are discrete, identifiable information 
technology assets (e.g., hardware, software, or firmware) that represent the building blocks of an 
information system. Information system components include commercial information technology 
products. Security functional requirements include security capabilities, security functions, and 
security mechanisms. Security strength requirements associated with such capabilities, functions, 
and mechanisms include degree of correctness, completeness, resistance to direct attack, and 
resistance to tampering or bypass. Security assurance requirements include: (i) development 
processes, procedures, practices, and methodologies; and (ii) evidence from development and 
assessment activities providing grounds for confidence that the required security functionality has 
been implemented and the required security strength has been achieved. Security documentation 
requirements address all phases of the system development life cycle. 
Security functionality, assurance, and documentation requirements are expressed in terms of 
security controls and control enhancements that have been selected through the tailoring process. 
The security control tailoring process includes, for example, the specification of parameter values 
through the use of assignment and selection statements and the specification of platform 
dependencies and implementation information. Security documentation provides user and 
administrator guidance regarding the implementation and operation of security controls. The level 
of detail required in security documentation is based on the security category or classification level 
of the information system and the degree to which organizations depend on the stated security 
capability, functions, or mechanisms to meet overall risk response expectations (as defined in the 
organizational risk management strategy). Security requirements can also include organizationally 
mandated configuration settings specifying allowed functions, ports, protocols, and services. 
Acceptance criteria for information systems, information system components, and information 
system services are defined in the same manner as such criteria for any organizational acquisition 
or procurement. The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Section 7.103 contains information 
security requirements from FISMA. Related controls: CM-6, PL-2, PS-7, SA-3, SA-5, SA-8, SA-

Control Enhancements: 
(1) ACQUISITION PROCESS | FUNCTIONAL PROPERTIES OF SECURITY CONTROLS  
The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or 
information system service to provide a description of the functional properties of the security 
controls to be employed. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Functional properties of security controls describe the functionality 
(i.e., security capability, functions, or mechanisms) visible at the interfaces of the controls and 
specifically exclude functionality and data structures internal to the operation of the controls. 
Related control: SA-5. 
(2) ACQUISITION PROCESS | DESIGN / IMPLEMENTATION INFORMATION FOR SECURITY CONTROLS  
The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or 
information system service to provide design and implementation information for the security 
controls to be employed that includes: [Selection (one or more): security-relevant external system 
interfaces; high-level design; low-level design; source code or hardware schematics; [Assignment: 
organization-defined design/implementation information]] at [Assignment: organization-defined

APPENDIX F-SA   PAGE F-159 
Supplemental Guidance:  Organizations may require different levels of detail in design and 
implementation documentation for security controls employed in organizational information 
systems, system components, or information system services based on mission/business 
requirements, requirements for trustworthiness/resiliency, and requirements for analysis and 
testing. Information systems can be partitioned into multiple subsystems. Each subsystem 
within the system can contain one or more modules. The high-level design for the system is 
expressed in terms of multiple subsystems and the interfaces between subsystems providing 
security-relevant functionality. The low-level design for the system is expressed in terms of 
modules with particular emphasis on software and firmware (but not excluding hardware) and 
the interfaces between modules providing security-relevant functionality. Source code and 
hardware schematics are typically referred to as the implementation representation of the 
information system. Related control: SA-5. 
(3) ACQUISITION PROCESS | DEVELOPMENT METHODS / TECHNIQUES / PRACTICES  
The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or 
information system service to demonstrate the use of a system development life cycle that 
includes [Assignment: organization-defined state-of-the-practice system/security engineering 
methods, software development methods, testing/evaluation/validation techniques, and quality 
control processes]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Following a well-defined system development life cycle that includes 
state-of-the-practice software development methods, systems/security engineering methods, 
quality control processes, and testing, evaluation, and validation techniques helps to reduce 
the number and severity of latent errors within information systems, system components, and 
information system services. Reducing the number/severity of such errors reduces the number 
of vulnerabilities in those systems, components, and services. Related control: SA-12. 
(4) ACQUISITION PROCESS | ASSIGNMENT OF COMPONENTS TO SYSTEMS  
[Withdrawn: Incorporated into CM-8 (9)]. 
(5) ACQUISITION PROCESS | SYSTEM / COMPONENT / SERVICE CONFIGURATIONS  
The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or 
information system service to: 
(a) Deliver the system, component, or service with [Assignment: organization-defined security 
configurations] implemented; and 
(b) Use the configurations as the default for any subsequent system, component, or service 
reinstallation or upgrade. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Security configurations include, for example, the U.S. Government 
Configuration Baseline (USGCB) and any limitations on functions, ports, protocols, and 
services. Security characteristics include, for example, requiring that all default passwords 
have been changed. Related control: CM-8. 
(6) ACQUISITION PROCESS | USE OF INFORMATION ASSURANCE PRODUCTS  
The organization: 
(a) Employs only government off-the-shelf (GOTS) or commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) 
information assurance (IA) and IA-enabled information technology products that compose an 
NSA-approved solution to protect classified information when the networks used to transmit

commercially provided information technology product relies on cryptographic functionality 
to enforce its security policy, that the cryptographic module is FIPS-validated. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Related controls: SC-12, SC-13. 
(8) ACQUISITION PROCESS | CONTINUOUS MONITORING PLAN  
The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or 
information system service to produce a plan for the continuous monitoring of security control 
effectiveness that contains [Assignment: organization-defined level of detail]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  The objective of continuous monitoring plans is to determine if the 
complete set of planned, required, and deployed security controls within the information 
system, system component, or information system service continue to be effective over time 
based on the inevitable changes that occur. Developer continuous monitoring plans include a 
sufficient level of detail such that the information can be incorporated into the continuous 
monitoring strategies and programs implemented by organizations. Related control: CA-7. 
(9) ACQUISITION PROCESS | FUNCTIONS / PORTS / PROTOCOLS / SERVICES IN USE  
The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or 
information system service to identify early in the system development life cycle, the functions, 
ports, protocols, and services intended for organizational use. 
Supplemental Guidance:  The identification of functions, ports, protocols, and services early in 
the system development life cycle (e.g., during the initial requirements definition and design 
phases) allows organizations to influence the design of the information system, information 
system component, or information system service. This early involvement in the life cycle 
helps organizations to avoid or minimize the use of functions, ports, protocols, or services that 
pose unnecessarily high risks and understand the trade-offs involved in blocking specific 
ports, protocols, or services (or when requiring information system service providers to do 
so). Early identification of functions, ports, protocols, and services avoids costly retrofitting 
of security controls after the information system, system component, or information system 
service has been implemented. SA-9 describes requirements for external information system 
services with organizations identifying which functions, ports, protocols, and services are 
provided from external sources. Related controls: CM-7, SA-9. 
(10) ACQUISITION PROCESS | USE OF APPROVED PIV PRODUCTS  
The organization employs only information technology products on the FIPS 201-approved 
products list for Personal Identity Verification (PIV) capability implemented within organizational 
information systems.

SA-5 INFORMATION SYSTEM DOCUMENTATION 
 Control:  The organization: 
a. Obtains administrator documentation for the information system, system component, or 
information system service that describes: 
1. Secure configuration, installation, and operation of the system, component, or service;  
2. Effective use and maintenance of security functions/mechanisms; and 
3. Known vulnerabilities regarding configuration and use of administrative (i.e., privileged) 
functions;

b. Obtains user documentation for the information system, system component, or information 
system service that describes: 
1. User-accessible security functions/mechanisms and how to effectively use those security 
functions/mechanisms; 
2. Methods for user interaction, which enables individuals to use the system, component, or 
service in a more secure manner; and 
3. User responsibilities in maintaining the security of the system, component, or service; 
c. Documents attempts to obtain information system, system component, or information system 
service documentation when such documentation is either unavailable or nonexistent and 
[Assignment: organization-defined actions] in response; 
d. Protects documentation as required, in accordance with the risk management strategy; and 
e. Distributes documentation to [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  This control helps organizational personnel understand the implementation 
and operation of security controls associated with information systems, system components, and 
information system services. Organizations consider establishing specific measures to determine 
the quality/completeness of the content provided. The inability to obtain needed documentation 
may occur, for example, due to the age of the information system/component or lack of support 
from developers and contractors. In those situations, organizations may need to recreate selected 
documentation if such documentation is essential to the effective implementation or operation of 
security controls. The level of protection provided for selected information system, component, or 
service documentation is commensurate with the security category or classification of the system. 
For example, documentation associated with a key DoD weapons system or command and control 
system would typically require a higher level of protection than a routine administrative system. 
Documentation that addresses information system vulnerabilities may also require an increased 
level of protection. Secure operation of the information system, includes, for example, initially 
starting the system and resuming secure system operation after any lapse in system operation.

SA-8 SECURITY ENGINEERING PRINCIPLES 
 Control:  The organization applies information system security engineering principles in the 
specification, design, development, implementation, and modification of the information system. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Organizations apply security engineering principles primarily to new 
development information systems or systems undergoing major upgrades. For legacy systems, 
organizations apply security engineering principles to system upgrades and modifications to the 
extent feasible, given the current state of hardware, software, and firmware within those systems. 
Security engineering principles include, for example: (i) developing layered protections; (ii) 
establishing sound security policy, architecture, and controls as the foundation for design; (iii) 
incorporating security requirements into the system development life cycle; (iv) delineating 
physical and logical security boundaries; (v) ensuring that system developers are trained on how to 
build secure software; (vi) tailoring security controls to meet organizational and operational needs; 
(vii) performing threat modeling to identify use cases, threat agents, attack vectors, and attack 
patterns as well as compensating controls and design patterns needed to mitigate risk; and (viii) 
reducing risk to acceptable levels, thus enabling informed risk management decisions. Related

SA-9 EXTERNAL INFORMATION SYSTEM SERVICES 
 Control:  The organization: 
a. Requires that providers of external information system services comply with organizational 
information security requirements and employ [Assignment: organization-defined security 
controls] in accordance with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, 
regulations, standards, and guidance; 
b. Defines and documents government oversight and user roles and responsibilities with regard  
to external information system services; and 
c. Employs [Assignment: organization-defined processes, methods, and techniques] to monitor 
security control compliance by external service providers on an ongoing basis. 
Supplemental Guidance:  External information system services are services that are implemented 
outside of the authorization boundaries of organizational information systems. This includes 
services that are used by, but not a part of, organizational information systems. FISMA and OMB 
policy require that organizations using external service providers that are processing, storing, or 
transmitting federal information or operating information systems on behalf of the federal 
government ensure that such providers meet the same security requirements that federal agencies 
are required to meet. Organizations establish relationships with external service providers in a 
variety of ways including, for example, through joint ventures, business partnerships, contracts, 
interagency agreements, lines of business arrangements, licensing agreements, and supply chain 
exchanges. The responsibility for managing risks from the use of external information system 
services remains with authorizing officials. For services external to organizations, a chain of trust 
requires that organizations establish and retain a level of confidence that each participating

APPENDIX F-SA   PAGE F-163 
provider in the potentially complex consumer-provider relationship provides adequate protection 
for the services rendered. The extent and nature of this chain of trust varies based on the 
relationships between organizations and the external providers. Organizations document the basis 
for trust relationships so the relationships can be monitored over time. External information 
system services documentation includes government, service providers, end user security roles and 
responsibilities, and service-level agreements. Service-level agreements define expectations of 
performance for security controls, describe measurable outcomes, and identify remedies and 
response requirements for identified instances of noncompliance. Related controls: CA-3, IR-7, 
PS-7. 
Control Enhancements: 
(1) EXTERNAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS | RISK ASSESSMENTS / ORGANIZATIONAL APPROVALS  
The organization: 
(a) Conducts an organizational assessment of risk prior to the acquisition or outsourcing of 
dedicated information security services; and 
(b) Ensures that the acquisition or outsourcing of dedicated information security services is 
approved by [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Dedicated information security services include, for example, incident 
monitoring, analysis and response, operation of information security-related devices such as 
firewalls, or key management services. Related controls: CA-6, RA-3. 
(2) EXTERNAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS | IDENTIFICATION OF FUNCTIONS / PORTS / PROTOCOLS / SERVICES  
The organization requires providers of [Assignment: organization-defined external information 
system services] to identify the functions, ports, protocols, and other services required for the use 
of such services. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Information from external service providers regarding the specific 
functions, ports, protocols, and services used in the provision of such services can be 
particularly useful when the need arises to understand the trade-offs involved in restricting 
certain functions/services or blocking certain ports/protocols. Related control: CM-7. 
(3) EXTERNAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS | ESTABLISH / MAINTAIN TRUST RELATIONSHIP WITH PROVIDERS  
The organization establishes, documents, and maintains trust relationships with external service 
providers based on [Assignment: organization-defined security requirements, properties, factors, 
or conditions defining acceptable trust relationships]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  The degree of confidence that the risk from using external services is 
at an acceptable level depends on the trust that organizations place in the external providers, 
individually or in combination. Trust relationships can help organization to gain increased 
levels of confidence that participating service providers are providing adequate protection for 
the services rendered. Such relationships can be complicated due to the number of potential 
entities participating in the consumer-provider interactions, subordinate relationships and 
levels of trust, and the types of interactions between the parties. In some cases, the degree of 
trust is based on the amount of direct control organizations are able to exert on external 
service providers with regard to employment of security controls necessary for the protection 
of the service/information and the evidence brought forth as to the effectiveness of those 
controls. The level of control is typically established by the terms and conditions of the 
contracts or service-level agreements and can range from extensive control (e.g., negotiating 
contracts or agreements that specify security requirements for the providers) to very limited 
control (e.g., using contracts or service-level agreements to obtain commodity services such as 
commercial telecommunications services). In other cases, levels of trust are based on factors 
that convince organizations that required security controls have been employed and that 
determinations of control effectiveness exist. For example, separately authorized external 
information system services provided to organizations through well-established business 
relationships may provide degrees of trust in such services within the tolerable risk range of 
the organizations using the services. External service providers may also outsource selected 
services to other external entities, making the trust relationship more difficult and complicated 
to manage. Depending on the nature of the services, organizations may find it very difficult to

place significant trust in external providers. This is not due to any inherent untrustworthiness 
on the part of providers, but to the intrinsic level of risk in the services. 
(4) EXTERNAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS | CONSISTENT INTERESTS OF CONSUMERS AND PROVIDERS  
The organization employs [Assignment: organization-defined security safeguards] to ensure that 
the interests of [Assignment: organization-defined external service providers] are consistent with 
and reflect organizational interests. 
Supplemental Guidance:  As organizations increasingly use external service providers, the 
possibility exists that the interests of the service providers may diverge from organizational 
interests. In such situations, simply having the correct technical, procedural, or operational 
safeguards in place may not be sufficient if the service providers that implement and control 
those safeguards are not operating in a manner consistent with the interests of the consuming 
organizations. Possible actions that organizations might take to address such concerns include, 
for example, requiring background checks for selected service provider personnel, examining 
ownership records, employing only trustworthy service providers (i.e., providers with which 
organizations have had positive experiences), and conducting periodic/unscheduled visits to 
service provider facilities. 
(5) EXTERNAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS | PROCESSING, STORAGE, AND SERVICE LOCATION  
The organization restricts the location of [Selection (one or more): information processing; 
information/data; information system services] to [Assignment: organization-defined locations] 
based on [Assignment: organization-defined requirements or conditions]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  The location of information processing, information/data storage, or 
information system services that are critical to organizations can have a direct impact on the 
ability of those organizations to successfully execute their missions/business functions. This 
situation exists when external providers control the location of processing, storage or services. 
The criteria external providers use for the selection of processing, storage, or service locations 
may be different from organizational criteria. For example, organizations may want to ensure 
that data/information storage locations are restricted to certain locations to facilitate incident 
response activities (e.g., forensic analyses, after-the-fact investigations) in case of information 
security breaches/compromises. Such incident response activities may be adversely affected 
by the governing laws or protocols in the locations where processing and storage occur and/or 
the locations from which information system services emanate.

Supplemental Guidance:  This control also applies to organizations conducting internal information 
systems development and integration. Organizations consider the quality and completeness of the 
configuration management activities conducted by developers as evidence of applying effective 
security safeguards. Safeguards include, for example, protecting from unauthorized modification 
or destruction, the master copies of all material used to generate security-relevant portions of the 
system hardware, software, and firmware. Maintaining the integrity of changes to the information 
system, information system component, or information system service requires configuration 
control throughout the system development life cycle to track authorized changes and prevent 
unauthorized changes. Configuration items that are placed under configuration management (if 
existence/use is required by other security controls) include: the formal model; the functional, 
high-level, and low-level design specifications; other design data; implementation documentation; 
source code and hardware schematics; the running version of the object code; tools for comparing 
new versions of security-relevant hardware descriptions and software/firmware source code with 
previous versions; and test fixtures and documentation. Depending on the mission/business needs 
of organizations and the nature of the contractual relationships in place, developers may provide 
configuration management support during the operations and maintenance phases of the life cycle. 
Related controls: CM-3, CM-4, CM-9, SA-12, SI-2.  
Control Enhancements: 
(1) DEVELOPER CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT | SOFTWARE / FIRMWARE INTEGRITY VERIFICATION  
The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or 
information system service to enable integrity verification of software and firmware components. 
Supplemental Guidance:  This control enhancement allows organizations to detect unauthorized 
changes to software and firmware components through the use of tools, techniques, and/or 
mechanisms provided by developers. Integrity checking mechanisms can also address 
counterfeiting of software and firmware components. Organizations verify the integrity of 
software and firmware components, for example, through secure one-way hashes provided by 
developers. Delivered software and firmware components also include any updates to such 
components. Related control: SI-7. 
(2) DEVELOPER CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT | ALTERNATIVE CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT PROCESSES  
The organization provides an alternate configuration management process using organizational 
personnel in the absence of a dedicated developer configuration management team. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Alternate configuration management processes may be required, for 
example, when organizations use commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) information technology 
products. Alternate configuration management processes include organizational personnel 
that: (i) are responsible for reviewing/approving proposed changes to information systems, 
system components, and information system services; and (ii) conduct security impact 
analyses prior to the implementation of any changes to systems, components, or services (e.g., 
a configuration control board that considers security impacts of changes during development 
and includes representatives of both the organization and the developer, when applicable). 
(3) DEVELOPER CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT | HARDWARE INTEGRITY VERIFICATION  
The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or 
information system service to enable integrity verification of hardware components. 
Supplemental Guidance:  This control enhancement allows organizations to detect unauthorized 
changes to hardware components through the use of tools, techniques, and/or mechanisms 
provided by developers. Organizations verify the integrity of hardware components, for 
example, with hard-to-copy labels and verifiable serial numbers provided by developers, and 
by requiring the implementation of anti-tamper technologies. Delivered hardware components 
also include updates to such components. Related control: SI-7. 
(4) DEVELOPER CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT | TRUSTED GENERATION 
The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or 
information system service to employ tools for comparing newly generated versions of security-
relevant hardware descriptions and software/firmware source and object code with previous 
versions.

Supplemental Guidance:  This control enhancement addresses changes to hardware, software, 
and firmware components between versions during development. In contrast, SA-10 (1) and 
SA-10 (3) allow organizations to detect unauthorized changes to hardware, software, and 
firmware components through the use of tools, techniques, and/or mechanisms provided by 
developers. 
(5) DEVELOPER CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT | MAPPING INTEGRITY FOR VERSION CONTROL 
The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or 
information system service to maintain the integrity of the mapping between the  master build data 
(hardware drawings and software/firmware code) describing the current version of security-
relevant hardware, software, and firmware and the on-site master copy of the data for the current 
version. 
Supplemental Guidance:  This control enhancement addresses changes to hardware, software, 
and firmware components during initial development and during system life cycle updates. 
Maintaining the integrity between the master copies of security-relevant hardware, software, 
and firmware (including designs and source code) and the equivalent data in master copies 
on-site in operational environments is essential to ensure the availability of organizational 
information systems supporting critical missions and/or business functions. 
(6) DEVELOPER CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT | TRUSTED DISTRIBUTION  
The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or 
information system service to execute procedures for ensuring that security-relevant hardware, 
software, and firmware updates distributed to the organization are exactly as specified by the 
master copies. 
Supplemental Guidance:  The trusted distribution of security-relevant hardware, software, and 
firmware updates helps to ensure that such updates are faithful representations of the master 
copies maintained by the developer and have not been tampered with during distribution.

SA-11 DEVELOPER SECURITY TESTING AND EVALUATION 
Control:  The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or 
information system service to: 
a. Create and implement a security assessment plan; 
b. Perform [Selection (one or more): unit; integration; system; regression] testing/evaluation at 
[Assignment: organization-defined depth and coverage]; 
c. Produce evidence of the execution of the security assessment plan and the results of the 
security testing/evaluation; 
d. Implement a verifiable flaw remediation process; and 
e. Correct flaws identified during security testing/evaluation. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Developmental security testing/evaluation occurs at all post‐design phases 
of the system development life cycle. Such testing/evaluation confirms that the required security 
controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, enforcing the desired security policy, 
and meeting established security requirements. Security properties of information systems may be 
affected by the interconnection of system components or changes to those components. These 
interconnections or changes (e.g., upgrading or replacing applications and operating systems) may 
adversely affect previously implemented security controls. This control provides additional types 
of security testing/evaluation that developers can conduct to reduce or eliminate potential flaws. 
Testing custom software applications may require approaches such as static analysis, dynamic

analysis, binary analysis, or a hybrid of the three approaches. Developers can employ these 
analysis approaches in a variety of tools (e.g., web-based application scanners, static analysis 
tools, binary analyzers) and in source code reviews. Security assessment plans provide the specific 
activities that developers plan to carry out including the types of analyses, testing, evaluation, and 
reviews of software and firmware components, the degree of rigor to be applied, and the types of 
artifacts produced during those processes. The depth of security testing/evaluation refers to the 
rigor and level of detail associated with the assessment process (e.g., black box, gray box, or white 
box testing). The coverage of security testing/evaluation refers to the scope (i.e., number and type) 
of the artifacts included in the assessment process. Contracts specify the acceptance criteria for 
security assessment plans, flaw remediation processes, and the evidence that the plans/processes 
have been diligently applied. Methods for reviewing and protecting assessment plans, evidence, 
and documentation are commensurate with the security category or classification level of the 
information system. Contracts may specify documentation protection requirements. Related 
controls: CA-2, CM-4, SA-3, SA-4, SA-5, SI-2. 
Control Enhancements: 
(1) DEVELOPER SECURITY TESTING AND EVALUATION | STATIC CODE ANALYSIS 
The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or 
information system service to employ static code analysis tools to identify common flaws and 
document the results of the analysis. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Static code analysis provides a technology and methodology for 
security reviews. Such analysis can be used to identify security vulnerabilities and enforce 
security coding practices. Static code analysis is most effective when used early in the 
development process, when each code change can be automatically scanned for potential 
weaknesses. Static analysis can provide clear remediation guidance along with defects to 
enable developers to fix such defects. Evidence of correct implementation of static analysis 
can include, for example, aggregate defect density for critical defect types, evidence that 
defects were inspected by developers or security professionals, and evidence that defects were 
fixed. An excessively high density of ignored findings (commonly referred to as ignored or 
false positives) indicates a potential problem with the analysis process or tool. In such cases, 
organizations weigh the validity of the evidence against evidence from other sources. 
(2) DEVELOPER SECURITY TESTING AND EVALUATION | THREAT AND VULNERABILITY ANALYSES  
The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or 
information system service to perform threat and vulnerability analyses and subsequent 
testing/evaluation of the as-built system, component, or service. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Applications may deviate significantly from the functional and design 
specifications created during the requirements and design phases of the system development 
life cycle. Therefore, threat and vulnerability analyses of information systems, system 
components, and information system services prior to delivery are critical to the effective 
operation of those systems, components, and services. Threat and vulnerability analyses at 
this phase of the life cycle help to ensure that design or implementation changes have been 
accounted for, and that any new vulnerabilities created as a result of those changes have been 
reviewed and mitigated. Related controls: PM-15, RA-5. 
(3) DEVELOPER SECURITY TESTING AND EVALUATION | INDEPENDENT VERIFICATION OF ASSESSMENT PLANS / 
EVIDENCE  
The organization: 
(a) Requires an independent agent satisfying [Assignment: organization-defined independence 
criteria] to verify the correct implementation of the developer security assessment plan and 
the evidence produced during security testing/evaluation; and 
(b) Ensures that the independent agent either is provided with sufficient information to complete 
the verification process or has been granted the authority to obtain such information. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Independent agents have the necessary qualifications (i.e., expertise, 
skills, training, and experience) to verify the correct implementation of developer security 
assessment plans. Related controls: AT-3, CA-7, RA-5, SA-12.

________________________________________________________________________________________________ 
APPENDIX F-SA   PAGE F-168 
(4) DEVELOPER SECURITY TESTING AND EVALUATION | MANUAL CODE REVIEWS  
The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or 
information system service to perform a manual code review of [Assignment: organization-defined 
specific code] using [Assignment: organization-defined processes, procedures, and/or 
techniques]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Manual code reviews are usually reserved for the critical software and 
firmware components of information systems. Such code reviews are uniquely effective at 
identifying weaknesses that require knowledge of the application’s requirements or context 
which are generally unavailable to more automated analytic tools and techniques such as 
static or dynamic analysis. Components benefiting from manual review include for example, 
verifying access control matrices against application controls and reviewing more detailed 
aspects of cryptographic implementations and controls. 
(5) DEVELOPER SECURITY TESTING AND EVALUATION | PENETRATION TESTING / ANALYSIS 
The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or 
information system service to perform penetration testing at [Assignment: organization-defined 
breadth/depth] and with [Assignment: organization-defined constraints]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Penetration testing is an assessment methodology in which assessors, 
using all available information technology product and/or information system documentation 
(e.g., product/system design specifications, source code, and administrator/operator manuals) 
and working under specific constraints, attempt to circumvent implemented security features 
of information technology products and information systems. Penetration testing can include, 
for example, white, gray, or black box testing with analyses performed by skilled security 
professionals simulating adversary actions. The objective of penetration testing is to uncover 
potential vulnerabilities in information technology products and information systems resulting 
from implementation errors, configuration faults, or other operational deployment weaknesses 
or deficiencies. Penetration tests can be performed in conjunction with automated and manual 
code reviews to provide greater levels of analysis than would ordinarily be possible. 
(6) DEVELOPER SECURITY TESTING AND EVALUATION | ATTACK SURFACE REVIEWS  
The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or 
information system service to perform attack surface reviews.  
Supplemental Guidance:  Attack surfaces of information systems are exposed areas that make 
those systems more vulnerable to cyber attacks. This includes any accessible areas where 
weaknesses or deficiencies in information systems (including the hardware, software, and 
firmware components) provide opportunities for adversaries to exploit vulnerabilities. Attack 
surface reviews ensure that developers: (i) analyze both design and implementation changes 
to information systems; and (ii) mitigate attack vectors generated as a result of the changes. 
Correction of identified flaws includes, for example, deprecation of unsafe functions. 
(7) DEVELOPER SECURITY TESTING AND EVALUATION | VERIFY SCOPE OF TESTING / EVALUATION 
The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or 
information system service to verify that the scope of security testing/evaluation provides 
complete coverage of required security controls at [Assignment: organization-defined depth of 
testing/evaluation]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Verifying that security testing/evaluation provides complete coverage 
of required security controls can be accomplished by a variety of analytic techniques ranging 
from informal to formal. Each of these techniques provides an increasing level of assurance 
corresponding to the degree of formality of the analysis. Rigorously demonstrating security 
control coverage at the highest levels of assurance can be provided by the use of formal 
modeling and analysis techniques including correlation between control implementation and 
corresponding test cases. 
(8) DEVELOPER SECURITY TESTING AND EVALUATION | DYNAMIC CODE ANALYSIS  
The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or 
information system service to employ dynamic code analysis tools to identify common flaws and 
document the results of the analysis. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Dynamic code analysis provides run-time verification of software 
programs, using tools capable of monitoring programs for memory corruption, user privilege

issues, and other potential security problems. Dynamic code analysis employs run-time tools 
to help to ensure that security functionality performs in the manner in which it was designed. 
A specialized type of dynamic analysis, known as fuzz testing, induces program failures by 
deliberately introducing malformed or random data into software programs. Fuzz testing 
strategies derive from the intended use of applications and the functional and design 
specifications for the applications.

SA-12 SUPPLY CHAIN PROTECTION 
 Control:  The organization protects against supply chain threats to the information system, system 
component, or information system service by employing [Assignment: organization-defined 
security safeguards] as part of a comprehensive, defense-in-breadth information security strategy. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Information systems (including system components that compose those 
systems) need to be protected throughout the system development life cycle (i.e., during design, 
development, manufacturing, packaging, assembly, distribution, system integration, operations, 
maintenance, and retirement). Protection of organizational information systems is accomplished 
through threat awareness, by the identification, management, and reduction of vulnerabilities at 
each phase of the life cycle and the use of complementary, mutually reinforcing strategies to 
respond to risk. Organizations consider implementing a standardized process to address supply 
chain risk with respect to information systems and system components, and to educate the 
acquisition workforce on threats, risk, and required security controls. Organizations use the 
acquisition/procurement processes to require supply chain entities to implement necessary security 
safeguards to: (i) reduce the likelihood of unauthorized modifications at each stage in the supply 
chain; and (ii) protect information systems and information system components, prior to taking 
delivery of such systems/components. This control enhancement also applies to information 
system services. Security safeguards include, for example: (i) security controls for development 
systems, development facilities, and external connections to development systems; (ii) vetting 
development personnel; and (iii) use of tamper-evident packaging during shipping/warehousing. 
Methods for reviewing and protecting development plans, evidence, and documentation are 
commensurate with the security category or classification level of the information system. 
Contracts may specify documentation protection requirements. Related controls: AT-3, CM-8, IR-
4, PE-16, PL-8, SA-3, SA-4, SA-8, SA-10, SA-14, SA-15, SA-18, SA-19, SC-29, SC-30, SC-38,

Control Enhancements: 
(1) SUPPLY CHAIN PROTECTION | ACQUISITION STRATEGIES / TOOLS / METHODS  
The organization employs [Assignment: organization-defined tailored acquisition strategies, 
contract tools, and procurement methods] for the purchase of the information system, system 
component, or information system service from suppliers.  
Supplemental Guidance:  The use of acquisition and procurement processes by organizations 
early in the system development life cycle provides an important vehicle to protect the supply 
chain. Organizations use available all-source intelligence analysis to inform the tailoring of 
acquisition strategies, tools, and methods. There are a number of different tools and 
techniques available (e.g., obscuring the end use of an information system or system 
component, using blind or filtered buys). Organizations also consider creating incentives for 
suppliers who: (i) implement required security safeguards; (ii) promote transparency into their 
organizational processes and security practices; (iii) provide additional vetting of the 
processes and security practices of subordinate suppliers, critical information system

components, and services; (iv) restrict purchases from specific suppliers or countries; and (v) 
provide contract language regarding the prohibition of tainted or counterfeit components. In 
addition, organizations consider minimizing the time between purchase decisions and required 
delivery to limit opportunities for adversaries to corrupt information system components or 
products. Finally, organizations can use trusted/controlled distribution, delivery, and 
warehousing options to reduce supply chain risk (e.g., requiring tamper-evident packaging of 
information system components during shipping and warehousing). Related control: SA-19. 
(2) SUPPLY CHAIN PROTECTION | SUPPLIER REVIEWS  
The organization conducts a supplier review prior to entering into a contractual agreement to 
acquire the information system, system component, or information system service.  
Supplemental Guidance:  Supplier reviews include, for example: (i) analysis of supplier 
processes used to design, develop, test, implement, verify, deliver, and support information 
systems, system components, and information system services; and (ii) assessment of supplier 
training and experience in developing systems, components, or services with the required 
security capability. These reviews provide organizations with increased levels of visibility 
into supplier activities during the system development life cycle to promote more effective 
supply chain risk management. Supplier reviews can also help to determine whether primary 
suppliers have security safeguards in place and a practice for vetting subordinate suppliers, for 
example, second- and third-tier suppliers, and any subcontractors.

[Withdrawn: Incorporated into SA-12 (1)]. 
(4) SUPPLY CHAIN PROTECTION | DIVERSITY OF SUPPLIERS  
[Withdrawn: Incorporated into SA-12 (13)].  
(5) SUPPLY CHAIN PROTECTION | LIMITATION OF HARM  
The organization employs [Assignment: organization-defined security safeguards] to limit harm 
from potential adversaries identifying and targeting the organizational supply chain. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Supply chain risk is part of the advanced persistent threat (APT). 
Security safeguards and countermeasures to reduce the probability of adversaries successfully 
identifying and targeting the supply chain include, for example: (i) avoiding the purchase of 
custom configurations to reduce the risk of acquiring information systems, components, or 
products that have been corrupted via supply chain actions targeted at specific organizations; 
(ii) employing a diverse set of suppliers to limit the potential harm from any given supplier in 
the supply chain; (iii) employing approved vendor lists with standing reputations in industry, 
and (iv) using procurement carve outs (i.e., exclusions to commitments or obligations). 
(6) SUPPLY CHAIN PROTECTION | MINIMIZING PROCUREMENT TIME 
 [Withdrawn: Incorporated into SA-12 (1)]. 
(7) SUPPLY CHAIN PROTECTION | ASSESSMENTS PRIOR TO SELECTION / ACCEPTANCE / UPDATE 
The organization conducts an assessment of the information system, system component, or 
information system service prior to selection, acceptance, or update. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Assessments include, for example, testing, evaluations, reviews, and 
analyses. Independent, third-party entities or organizational personnel conduct assessments of 
systems, components, products, tools, and services. Organizations conduct assessments to 
uncover unintentional vulnerabilities and intentional vulnerabilities including, for example, 
malicious code, malicious processes, defective software, and counterfeits. Assessments can 
include, for example, static analyses, dynamic analyses, simulations, white, gray, and black 
box testing, fuzz testing, penetration testing, and ensuring that components or services are 
genuine (e.g., using tags, cryptographic hash verifications, or digital signatures). Evidence 
generated during security assessments is documented for follow-on actions carried out by 
organizations. Related controls: CA-2, SA-11. 
(8) SUPPLY CHAIN PROTECTION | USE OF ALL-SOURCE INTELLIGENCE  
The organization uses all-source intelligence analysis of suppliers and potential suppliers of the 
information system, system component, or information system service. 
Special Publication 800-53 Revision 4                                  Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems

________________________________________________________________________________________________ 
APPENDIX F-SA   PAGE F-171 
Supplemental Guidance:  All-source intelligence analysis is employed by organizations to 
inform engineering, acquisition, and risk management decisions. All-source intelligence 
consists of intelligence products and/or organizations and activities that incorporate all 
sources of information, most frequently including human intelligence, imagery intelligence, 
measurement and signature intelligence, signals intelligence, and open source data in the 
production of finished intelligence. Where available, such information is used to analyze the 
risk of both intentional and unintentional vulnerabilities from development, manufacturing, 
and delivery processes, people, and the environment. This review is performed on suppliers at 
multiple tiers in the supply chain sufficient to manage risks. Related control: SA-15. 
(9) SUPPLY CHAIN PROTECTION | OPERATIONS SECURITY  
The organization employs [Assignment: organization-defined Operations Security (OPSEC) 
safeguards] in accordance with classification guides to protect supply chain-related information 
for the information system, system component, or information system service. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Supply chain information includes, for example: user identities; uses 
for information systems, information system components, and information system services; 
supplier identities; supplier processes; security requirements; design specifications; testing 
and evaluation results; and system/component configurations. This control enhancement 
expands the scope of OPSEC to include suppliers and potential suppliers. OPSEC is a process 
of identifying critical information and subsequently analyzing friendly actions attendant to 
operations and other activities to: (i) identify those actions that can be observed by potential 
adversaries; (ii) determine indicators that adversaries might obtain that could be interpreted or 
pieced together to derive critical information in sufficient time to cause harm to organizations; 
(iii) implement safeguards or countermeasures to eliminate or reduce to an acceptable level, 
exploitable vulnerabilities; and (iv) consider how aggregated information may compromise 
the confidentiality of users or uses of the supply chain. OPSEC may require organizations to 
withhold critical mission/business information from suppliers and may include the use of 
intermediaries to hide the end use, or users, of information systems, system components, or 
information system services. Related control: PE-21. 
(10) SUPPLY CHAIN PROTECTION | VALIDATE AS GENUINE AND NOT ALTERED  
The organization employs [Assignment: organization-defined security safeguards] to validate that 
the information system or system component received is genuine and has not been altered. 
Supplemental Guidance:  For some information system components, especially hardware, there 
are technical means to help determine if the components are genuine or have been altered. 
Security safeguards used to validate the authenticity of information systems and information 
system components include, for example, optical/nanotechnology tagging and side-channel 
analysis. For hardware, detailed bill of material information can highlight the elements with 
embedded logic complete with component and production location. 
(11) SUPPLY CHAIN PROTECTION | PENETRATION TESTING / ANALYSIS OF ELEMENTS, PROCESSES, AND ACTORS 
The organization employs [Selection (one or more): organizational analysis, independent third-
party analysis, organizational penetration testing, independent third-party penetration testing] of 
[Assignment: organization-defined supply chain elements, processes, and actors] associated with 
the information system, system component, or information system service. 
Supplemental Guidance:  This control enhancement addresses analysis and/or testing of the 
supply chain, not just delivered items. Supply chain elements are information technology 
products or product components that contain programmable logic and that are critically 
important to information system functions. Supply chain processes include, for example: (i) 
hardware, software, and firmware development processes; (ii) shipping/handling procedures; 
(iii) personnel and physical security programs; (iv) configuration management tools/measures 
to maintain provenance; or (v) any other programs, processes, or procedures associated with 
the production/distribution of supply chain elements. Supply chain actors are individuals with 
specific roles and responsibilities in the supply chain. The evidence generated during analyses 
and testing of supply chain elements, processes, and actors is documented and used to inform 
organizational risk management activities and decisions. Related control: RA-5.

________________________________________________________________________________________________ 
APPENDIX F-SA   PAGE F-172 
(12) SUPPLY CHAIN PROTECTION | INTER-ORGANIZATIONAL AGREEMENTS  
The organization establishes inter-organizational agreements and procedures with entities 
involved in the supply chain for the information system, system component, or information system 
service. 
Supplemental Guidance:  The establishment of inter-organizational agreements and procedures 
provides for notification of supply chain compromises. Early notification of supply chain 
compromises that can potentially adversely affect or have adversely affected organizational 
information systems, including critical system components, is essential for organizations to 
provide appropriate responses to such incidents. 
(13) SUPPLY CHAIN PROTECTION | CRITICAL INFORMATION SYSTEM COMPONENTS  
The organization employs [Assignment: organization-defined security safeguards] to ensure an 
adequate supply of [Assignment: organization-defined critical information system components]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Adversaries can attempt to impede organizational operations by 
disrupting the supply of critical information system components or corrupting supplier 
operations. Safeguards to ensure adequate supplies of critical information system components 
include, for example: (i) the use of multiple suppliers throughout the supply chain for the 
identified critical components; and (ii) stockpiling of spare components to ensure operation 
during mission-critical times. 
(14) SUPPLY CHAIN PROTECTION | IDENTITY AND TRACEABILITY 
The organization establishes and retains unique identification of [Assignment: organization-
defined supply chain elements, processes, and actors] for the information system, system 
component, or information system service. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Knowing who and what is in the supply chains of organizations is 
critical to gaining visibility into what is happening within such supply chains, as well as 
monitoring and identifying high-risk events and activities. Without reasonable visibility and 
traceability into supply chains (i.e., elements, processes, and actors), it is very difficult for 
organizations to understand and therefore manage risk, and to reduce the likelihood of adverse 
events. Uniquely identifying acquirer and integrator roles, organizations, personnel, mission 
and element processes, testing and evaluation procedures, delivery mechanisms, support 
mechanisms, communications/delivery paths, and disposal/final disposition activities as well 
as the components and tools used, establishes a foundational identity structure for assessment 
of supply chain activities. For example, labeling (using serial numbers) and tagging (using 
radio-frequency identification [RFID] tags) individual supply chain elements including 
software packages, modules, and hardware devices, and processes associated with those 
elements can be used for this purpose. Identification methods are sufficient to support the 
provenance in the event of a supply chain issue or adverse supply chain event. 
(15) SUPPLY CHAIN PROTECTION | PROCESSES TO ADDRESS WEAKNESSES OR DEFICIENCIES  
The organization establishes a process to address weaknesses or deficiencies in supply chain 
elements identified during independent or organizational assessments of such elements. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Evidence generated during independent or organizational assessments 
of supply chain elements (e.g., penetration testing, audits, verification/validation activities) is 
documented and used in follow-on processes implemented by organizations to respond to the 
risks related to the identified weaknesses and deficiencies. Supply chain elements include, for 
example, supplier development processes and supplier distribution systems.

SA-13 TRUSTWORTHINESS 
 Control:  The organization: 
a. Describes the trustworthiness required in the [Assignment: organization-defined information 
system, information system component, or information system service] supporting its critical 
missions/business functions; and 
b. Implements [Assignment: organization-defined assurance overlay] to achieve such 
trustworthiness. 
Supplemental Guidance:  This control helps organizations to make explicit trustworthiness decisions 
when designing, developing, and implementing information systems that are needed to conduct 
critical organizational missions/business functions. Trustworthiness is a characteristic/property of 
an information system that expresses the degree to which the system can be expected to preserve 
the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the information it processes, stores, or transmits.  
Trustworthy information systems are systems that are capable of being trusted to operate within 
defined levels of risk despite the environmental disruptions, human errors, and purposeful attacks 
that are expected to occur in the specified environments of operation. Trustworthy systems are 
important to mission/business success. Two factors affecting the trustworthiness of information 
systems include: (i) security functionality (i.e., the security features, functions, and/or mechanisms 
employed within the system and its environment of operation); and (ii) security assurance (i.e., the 
grounds for confidence that the security functionality is effective in its application). Developers, 
implementers, operators, and maintainers of organizational information systems can increase the 
level of assurance (and trustworthiness), for example, by employing well-defined security policy 
models, structured and rigorous hardware, software, and firmware development techniques, sound 
system/security engineering principles, and secure configuration settings (defined by a set of 
assurance-related security controls in Appendix E). 
Assurance is also based on the assessment of evidence produced during the system development 
life cycle. Critical missions/business functions are supported by high-impact systems and the 
associated assurance requirements for such systems. The additional assurance controls in Table E-
4 in Appendix E (designated as optional) can be used to develop and implement high-assurance 
solutions for specific information systems and system components using the concept of overlays 
described in Appendix I. Organizations select assurance overlays that have been developed, 
validated, and approved for community adoption (e.g., cross-organization, governmentwide), 
limiting the development of such overlays on an organization-by-organization basis. Organizations 
can conduct criticality analyses as described in SA-14, to determine the information systems, 
system components, or information system services that require high-assurance solutions. 
Trustworthiness requirements and assurance overlays can be described in the security plans for 
organizational information systems. Related controls: RA-2, SA-4, SA-8, SA-14, SC-3.

APPENDIX F-SA   PAGE F-174 
Supplemental Guidance:  Criticality analysis is a key tenet of supply chain risk management and 
informs the prioritization of supply chain protection activities such as attack surface reduction, use 
of all-source intelligence, and tailored acquisition strategies. Information system engineers can 
conduct an end-to-end functional decomposition of an information system to identify mission-
critical functions and components. The functional decomposition includes the identification of 
core organizational missions supported by the system, decomposition into the specific functions to 
perform those missions, and traceability to the hardware, software, and firmware components that 
implement those functions, including when the functions are shared by many components within 
and beyond the information system boundary. Information system components that allow for 
unmediated access to critical components or functions are considered critical due to the inherent 
vulnerabilities such components create. Criticality is assessed in terms of the impact of the 
function or component failure on the ability of the component to complete the organizational 
missions supported by the information system. A criticality analysis is performed whenever an 
architecture or design is being developed or modified, including upgrades. Related controls: CP-2, 
PL-2, PL-8, PM-1, SA-8, SA-12, SA-13, SA-15, SA-20.

SA-15 DEVELOPMENT PROCESS, STANDARDS, AND TOOLS 
 Control:  The organization: 
a. Requires the developer of the information system, system component, or information system 
service to follow a documented development process that: 
1. Explicitly addresses security requirements; 
2. Identifies the standards and tools used in the development process; 
3. Documents the specific tool options and tool configurations used in the development 
process; and 
4. Documents, manages, and ensures the integrity of changes to the process and/or tools 
used in development; and 
b. Reviews the development process, standards, tools, and tool options/configurations 
[Assignment: organization-defined frequency] to determine if the process, standards, tools, 
and tool options/configurations selected and employed can satisfy [Assignment: organization-
defined security requirements]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Development tools include, for example, programming languages and 
computer-aided design (CAD) systems. Reviews of development processes can include, for 
example, the use of maturity models to determine the potential effectiveness of such processes. 
Maintaining the integrity of changes to tools and processes enables accurate supply chain risk 
assessment and mitigation, and requires robust configuration control throughout the life cycle 
(including design, development, transport, delivery, integration, and maintenance) to track 
authorized changes and prevent unauthorized changes. Related controls: SA-3, SA-8.

APPENDIX F-SA   PAGE F-175 
Control Enhancements: 
(1) DEVELOPMENT PROCESS, STANDARDS, AND TOOLS | QUALITY METRICS  
The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or 
information system service to: 
(a) Define quality metrics at the beginning of the development process; and 
(b) Provide evidence of meeting the quality metrics [Selection (one or more): [Assignment: 
organization-defined frequency]; [Assignment: organization-defined program review 
milestones]; upon delivery]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Organizations use quality metrics to establish minimum acceptable 
levels of information system quality. Metrics may include quality gates which are collections 
of completion criteria or sufficiency standards representing the satisfactory execution of 
particular phases of the system development project. A quality gate, for example, may require 
the elimination of all compiler warnings or an explicit determination that the warnings have 
no impact on the effectiveness of required security capabilities. During the execution phases 
of development projects, quality gates provide clear, unambiguous indications of progress. 
Other metrics apply to the entire development project. These metrics can include defining the 
severity thresholds of vulnerabilities, for example, requiring no known vulnerabilities in the 
delivered information system with a Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) severity 
of Medium or High. 
(2) DEVELOPMENT PROCESS, STANDARDS, AND TOOLS | SECURITY TRACKING TOOLS  
The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or 
information system service to select and employ a security tracking tool for use during the 
development process. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Information system development teams select and deploy security 
tracking tools, including, for example, vulnerability/work item tracking systems that facilitate 
assignment, sorting, filtering, and tracking of completed work items or tasks associated with 
system development processes. 
(3) DEVELOPMENT PROCESS, STANDARDS, AND TOOLS | CRITICALITY ANALYSIS  
The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or 
information system service to perform a criticality analysis at [Assignment: organization-defined 
breadth/depth] and at [Assignment: organization-defined decision points in the system 
development life cycle]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  This control enhancement provides developer input to the criticality 
analysis performed by organizations in SA-14. Developer input is essential to such analysis 
because organizations may not have access to detailed design documentation for information 
system components that are developed as commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) information 
technology products (e.g., functional specifications, high-level designs, low-level designs, and 
source code/hardware schematics). Related controls: SA-4, SA-14. 
(4) DEVELOPMENT PROCESS, STANDARDS, AND TOOLS | THREAT MODELING / VULNERABILITY ANALYSIS  
The organization requires that developers perform threat modeling and a vulnerability analysis for 
the information system at [Assignment: organization-defined breadth/depth] that: 
(a) Uses [Assignment: organization-defined information concerning impact, environment of 
operations, known or assumed threats, and acceptable risk levels]; 
(b) Employs [Assignment: organization-defined tools and methods]; and 
(c) Produces evidence that meets [Assignment: organization-defined acceptance criteria]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Related control: SA-4. 
(5) DEVELOPMENT PROCESS, STANDARDS, AND TOOLS | ATTACK SURFACE REDUCTION  
The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or 
information system service to reduce attack surfaces to [Assignment: organization-defined 
thresholds]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Attack surface reduction is closely aligned with developer threat and 
vulnerability analyses and information system architecture and design. Attack surface 
reduction is a means of reducing risk to organizations by giving attackers less opportunity to 
exploit weaknesses or deficiencies (i.e., potential vulnerabilities) within information systems,

APPENDIX F-SA   PAGE F-176 
information system components, and information system services. Attack surface reduction 
includes, for example, applying the principle of least privilege, employing layered defenses, 
applying the principle of least functionality (i.e., restricting ports, protocols, functions, and 
services), deprecating unsafe functions, and eliminating application programming interfaces 
(APIs) that are vulnerable to cyber attacks. Related control: CM-7. 
(6) DEVELOPMENT PROCESS, STANDARDS, AND TOOLS | CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT  
The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or 
information system service to implement an explicit process to continuously improve the 
development process. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Developers of information systems, information system components, 
and information system services consider the effectiveness/efficiency of current development 
processes for meeting quality objectives and addressing security capabilities in current threat 
environments. 
(7) DEVELOPMENT PROCESS, STANDARDS, AND TOOLS | AUTOMATED VULNERABILITY ANALYSIS  
The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or 
information system service to: 
(a) Perform an automated vulnerability analysis using [Assignment: organization-defined tools]; 
(b) Determine the exploitation potential for discovered vulnerabilities; 
(c) Determine potential risk mitigations for delivered vulnerabilities; and 
(d) Deliver the outputs of the tools and results of the analysis to [Assignment: organization-
defined personnel or roles]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Related control: RA-5. 
(8) DEVELOPMENT PROCESS, STANDARDS, AND TOOLS | REUSE OF THREAT / VULNERABILITY INFORMATION  
The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or 
information system service to use threat modeling and vulnerability analyses from similar systems, 
components, or services to inform the current development process. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Analysis of vulnerabilities found in similar software applications can 
inform potential design or implementation issues for information systems under development. 
Similar information systems or system components may exist within developer organizations. 
Authoritative vulnerability information is available from a variety of public and private sector 
sources including, for example, the National Vulnerability Database. 
(9) DEVELOPMENT PROCESS, STANDARDS, AND TOOLS | USE OF LIVE DATA  
The organization approves, documents, and controls the use of live data in development and test 
environments for the information system, system component, or information system service. 
Supplemental Guidance:  The use of live data in preproduction environments can result in 
significant risk to organizations. Organizations can minimize such risk by using test or 
dummy data during the development and testing of information systems, information system 
components, and information system services. 
(10) DEVELOPMENT PROCESS, STANDARDS, AND TOOLS | INCIDENT RESPONSE PLAN  
The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or 
information system service to provide an incident response plan. 
Supplemental Guidance:  The incident response plan for developers of information systems, 
system components, and information system services is incorporated into organizational 
incident response plans to provide the type of incident response information not readily 
available to organizations. Such information may be extremely helpful, for example, when 
organizations respond to vulnerabilities in commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) information 
technology products. Related control: IR-8. 
(11) DEVELOPMENT PROCESS, STANDARDS, AND TOOLS | ARCHIVE INFORMATION SYSTEM / COMPONENT  
The organization requires the developer of the information system or system component to archive 
the system or component to be released or delivered together with the corresponding evidence 
supporting the final security review.

use and operation of the implemented security functions, controls, and/or mechanisms. 
Supplemental Guidance:  This control applies to external and internal (in-house) developers. Training 
of personnel is an essential element to ensure the effectiveness of security controls implemented 
within organizational information systems. Training options include, for example, classroom-style 
training, web-based/computer-based training, and hands-on training. Organizations can also 
request sufficient training materials from developers to conduct in-house training or offer self-
training to organizational personnel. Organizations determine the type of training necessary and 
may require different types of training for different security functions, controls, or mechanisms.

SA-17 DEVELOPER SECURITY ARCHITECTURE AND DESIGN 
Control:  The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or 
information system service to produce a design specification and security architecture that: 
a. Is consistent with and supportive of the organization’s security architecture which is 
established within and is an integrated part of the organization’s enterprise architecture; 
b. Accurately and completely describes the required security functionality, and the allocation of 
security controls among physical and logical components; and 
c. Expresses how individual security functions, mechanisms, and services work together to 
provide required security capabilities and a unified approach to protection. 
Supplemental Guidance:  This control is primarily directed at external developers, although it could 
also be used for internal (in-house) development. In contrast, PL-8 is primarily directed at internal 
developers to help ensure that organizations develop an information security architecture and such 
security architecture is integrated or tightly coupled to the enterprise architecture. This distinction 
is important if/when organizations outsource the development of information systems, information 
system components, or information system services to external entities, and there is a requirement 
to demonstrate consistency with the organization’s enterprise architecture and information security 
architecture. Related controls: PL-8, PM-7, SA-3, SA-8. 
Control Enhancements: 
(1) DEVELOPER SECURITY ARCHITECTURE AND DESIGN | FORMAL POLICY MODEL  
The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or 
information system service to:

                                                                                               and Organizations 
________________________________________________________________________________________________ 
APPENDIX F-SA   PAGE F-178 
(a) Produce, as an integral part of the development process, a formal policy model describing the 
[Assignment: organization-defined elements of organizational security policy] to be enforced; 
and 
(b) Prove that the formal policy model is internally consistent and sufficient to enforce the 
defined elements of the organizational security policy when implemented. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Formal models describe specific behaviors or security policies using 
formal languages, thus enabling the correctness of those behaviors/policies to be formally 
proven. Not all components of information systems can be modeled, and generally, formal 
specifications are scoped to specific behaviors or policies of interest (e.g., nondiscretionary 
access control policies). Organizations choose the particular formal modeling language and 
approach based on the nature of the behaviors/policies to be described and the available tools. 
Formal modeling tools include, for example, Gypsy and Zed. 
(2) DEVELOPER SECURITY ARCHITECTURE AND DESIGN | SECURITY-RELEVANT COMPONENTS 
The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or 
information system service to: 
(a) Define security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware; and 
(b) Provide a rationale that the definition for security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware is 
complete. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware represent the 
portion of the information system, component, or service that must be trusted to perform 
correctly in order to maintain required security properties. Related control: SA-5. 
(3) DEVELOPER SECURITY ARCHITECTURE AND DESIGN | FORMAL CORRESPONDENCE  
The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or 
information system service to: 
(a) Produce, as an integral part of the development process, a formal top-level specification that 
specifies the interfaces to security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware in terms of 
exceptions, error messages, and effects; 
(b) Show via proof to the extent feasible with additional informal demonstration as necessary, 
that the formal top-level specification is consistent with the formal policy model; 
(c) Show via informal demonstration, that the formal top-level specification completely covers the 
interfaces to security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware; 
(d) Show that the formal top-level specification is an accurate description of the implemented 
security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware; and 
(e) Describe the security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware mechanisms not addressed 
in the formal top-level specification but strictly internal to the security-relevant hardware, 
software, and firmware. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Correspondence is an important part of the assurance gained through 
modeling. It demonstrates that the implementation is an accurate transformation of the model, 
and that any additional code or implementation details present have no impact on the 
behaviors or policies being modeled. Formal methods can be used to show that the high-level 
security properties are satisfied by the formal information system description, and that the 
formal system description is correctly implemented by a description of some lower level, for 
example a hardware description. Consistency between the formal top-level specification and 
the formal policy models is generally not amenable to being fully proven. Therefore, a 
combination of formal/informal methods may be needed to show such consistency. 
Consistency between the formal top-level specification and the implementation may require 
the use of an informal demonstration due to limitations in the applicability of formal methods 
to prove that the specification accurately reflects the implementation. Hardware, software, and 
firmware mechanisms strictly internal to security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware 
include, for example, mapping registers and direct memory input/output. Related control: SA-

(a) Produce, as an integral part of the development process, an informal descriptive top-level 
specification that specifies the interfaces to security-relevant hardware, software, and

(b) Show via [Selection: informal demonstration, convincing argument with formal methods as 
feasible] that the descriptive top-level specification is consistent with the formal policy model; 
(c) Show via informal demonstration, that the descriptive top-level specification completely  
covers the interfaces to security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware; 
(d) Show that the descriptive top-level specification is an accurate description of the interfaces to 
security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware; and 
(e) Describe the security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware mechanisms not addressed 
in the descriptive top-level specification but strictly internal to the security-relevant hardware, 
software, and firmware. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Correspondence is an important part of the assurance gained through 
modeling. It demonstrates that the implementation is an accurate transformation of the model, 
and that any additional code or implementation details present has no impact on the behaviors 
or policies being modeled. Consistency between the descriptive top-level specification (i.e., 
high-level/low-level design) and the formal policy model is generally not amenable to being 
fully proven. Therefore, a combination of formal/informal methods may be needed to show 
such consistency. Hardware, software, and firmware mechanisms strictly internal to security-
relevant hardware, software, and firmware include, for example, mapping registers and direct 
memory input/output. Related control: SA-5. 
(5) DEVELOPER SECURITY ARCHITECTURE AND DESIGN | CONCEPTUALLY SIMPLE DESIGN  
The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or 
information system service to: 
(a) Design and structure the security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware to use a 
complete, conceptually simple protection mechanism with precisely defined semantics; and 
(b) Internally structure the security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware with specific regard 
for this mechanism. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Related control: SC-3.

(1) TAMPER RESISTANCE AND DETECTION | MULTIPLE PHASES OF SDLC  
The organization employs anti-tamper technologies and techniques during multiple phases in the 
system development life cycle including design, development, integration, operations, and 
maintenance. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Organizations use a combination of hardware and software techniques 
for tamper resistance and detection. Organizations employ obfuscation and self-checking, for 
example, to make reverse engineering and modifications more difficult, time-consuming, and 
expensive for adversaries. Customization of information systems and system components can 
make substitutions easier to detect and therefore limit damage. Related control: SA-3. 
(2) TAMPER RESISTANCE AND DETECTION | INSPECTION OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS, COMPONENTS, OR DEVICES  
The organization inspects [Assignment: organization-defined information systems, system 
components, or devices] [Selection (one or more): at random; at [Assignment: organization-

detect tampering. 
Supplemental Guidance:  This control enhancement addresses both physical and logical 
tampering and is typically applied to mobile devices, notebook computers, or other system 
components taken out of organization-controlled areas. Indications of need for inspection 
include, for example, when individuals return from travel to high-risk locations. Related

detect and prevent counterfeit components from entering the information system; and 
b. Reports counterfeit information system components to [Selection (one or more): source of 
counterfeit component; [Assignment: organization-defined external reporting organizations]; 
[Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles]].      
Supplemental Guidance:  Sources of counterfeit components include, for example, manufacturers, 
developers, vendors, and contractors. Anti-counterfeiting policy and procedures support tamper 
resistance and provide a level of protection against the introduction of malicious code. External 
reporting organizations include, for example, US-CERT. Related controls: PE-3, SA-12, SI-7.

SA-20 CUSTOMIZED DEVELOPMENT OF CRITICAL COMPONENTS 
 Control:  The organization re-implements or custom develops [Assignment: organization-defined

Supplemental Guidance:  Organizations determine that certain information system components likely 
cannot be trusted due to specific threats to and vulnerabilities in those components, and for which 
there are no viable security controls to adequately mitigate the resulting risk. Re-implementation 
or custom development of such components helps to satisfy requirements for higher assurance. 
This is accomplished by initiating changes to system components (including hardware, software, 
and firmware) such that the standard attacks by adversaries are less likely to succeed. In situations 
where no alternative sourcing is available and organizations choose not to re-implement or custom 
develop critical information system components, additional safeguards can be employed (e.g., 
enhanced auditing, restrictions on source code and system utility access, and protection from 
deletion of system and application files. Related controls: CP-2, SA-8, SA-14.

b. Satisfy [Assignment: organization-defined additional personnel screening criteria]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Because the information system, system component, or information system 
service may be employed in critical activities essential to the national and/or economic security 
interests of the United States, organizations have a strong interest in ensuring that the developer is 
trustworthy. The degree of trust required of the developer may need to be consistent with that of 
the individuals accessing the information system/component/service once deployed. Examples of 
authorization and personnel screening criteria include clearance, satisfactory background checks, 
citizenship, and nationality. Trustworthiness of developers may also include a review and analysis 
of company ownership and any relationships the company has with entities potentially affecting 
the quality/reliability of the systems, components, or services being developed. Related controls:

a. Replaces information system components when support for the components is no longer 
available from the developer, vendor, or manufacturer; and 
b. Provides justification and documents approval for the continued use of unsupported system 
components required to satisfy mission/business needs. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Support for information system components includes, for example, 
software patches, firmware updates, replacement parts, and maintenance contracts. Unsupported 
components (e.g., when vendors are no longer providing critical software patches), provide a 
substantial opportunity for adversaries to exploit new weaknesses discovered in the currently 
installed components. Exceptions to replacing unsupported system components may include, for 
example, systems that provide critical mission/business capability where newer technologies are 
not available or where the systems are so isolated that installing replacement components is not an 
option. Related controls: PL-2, SA-3.

support for selected information system components that are no longer supported by the 
original developers, vendors, or manufacturers when such components remain essential to 
mission/business operations. Organizations can establish in-house support, for example, by 
developing customized patches for critical software components or secure the services of 
external providers who through contractual relationships, provide ongoing support for the 
designated unsupported components. Such contractual relationships can include, for example, 
Open Source Software value-added vendors.

SYSTEM AND SERVICES ACQUISITION CONTROLS 
DEVELOPMENT OF SYSTEMS, COMPONENTS, AND SERVICES 
With the renewed emphasis on trustworthy information systems and supply chain security, it is 
essential that organizations have the capability to express their information security requirements 
with clarity and specificity in order to engage the information technology industry and obtain the 
systems, components, and services necessary for mission and business success. To ensure that 
organizations have such capability, this publication provides a set of security controls in the System 
and Services Acquisition family (i.e., SA family) addressing requirements for the development of 
information systems, information technology products, and information system services. Therefore, 
many of the controls in the SA family are directed at developers of those systems, components, and 
services. It is important for organizations to recognize that the scope of the security controls in the 
SA family includes all system/component/service development and the developers associated with 
such development whether the development is conducted by internal organizational personnel or by 
external developers through the contracting/acquisition process. Affected controls include SA-8, 
SA-10, SA-11, SA-15, SA-16, SA-17, SA-20, and SA-21.

2. Procedures to facilitate the implementation of the system and communications protection 
policy and associated system and communications protection controls; and 
b. Reviews and updates the current: 
1. System and communications protection policy [Assignment: organization-defined

Supplemental Guidance:  This control addresses the establishment of policy and procedures for the 
effective implementation of selected security controls and control enhancements in the SC family. 
Policy and procedures reflect applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, 
policies, standards, and guidance. Security program policies and procedures at the organization 
level may make the need for system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The policy can 
be included as part of the general information security policy for organizations or conversely, can 
be represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex nature of certain organizations. The 
procedures can be established for the security program in general and for particular information 
systems, if needed. The organizational risk management strategy is a key factor in establishing 
policy and procedures. Related control: PM-9.

Control:  The information system separates user functionality (including user interface services) 
from information system management functionality. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Information system management functionality includes, for example, 
functions necessary to administer databases, network components, workstations, or servers, and 
typically requires privileged user access. The separation of user functionality from information 
system management functionality is either physical or logical. Organizations implement separation 
of system management-related functionality from user functionality by using different computers, 
different central processing units, different instances of operating systems, different network 
addresses, virtualization techniques, or combinations of these or other methods, as appropriate. 
This type of separation includes, for example, web administrative interfaces that use separate 
authentication methods for users of any other information system resources. Separation of system 
and user functionality may include isolating administrative interfaces on different domains and 
with additional access controls. Related controls: SA-4, SA-8, SC-3.

Control Enhancements: 
(1) APPLICATION PARTITIONING | INTERFACES FOR NON-PRIVILEGED USERS  
The information system prevents the presentation of information system management-related 
functionality at an interface for non-privileged users. 
Supplemental Guidance:  This control enhancement ensures that administration options (e.g., 
administrator privileges) are not available to general users (including prohibiting the use of 
the grey-out option commonly used to eliminate accessibility to such information). Such 
restrictions include, for example, not presenting administration options until users establish 
sessions with administrator privileges. Related control: AC-3.

SC-3 SECURITY FUNCTION ISOLATION  
Control:  The information system isolates security functions from nonsecurity functions. 
Supplemental Guidance:  The information system isolates security functions from nonsecurity 
functions by means of an isolation boundary (implemented via partitions and domains). Such 
isolation controls access to and protects the integrity of the hardware, software, and firmware that 
perform those security functions. Information systems implement code separation (i.e., separation 
of security functions from nonsecurity functions) in a number of ways, including, for example, 
through the provision of security kernels via processor rings or processor modes. For non-kernel 
code, security function isolation is often achieved through file system protections that serve to 
protect the code on disk, and address space protections that protect executing code. Information 
systems restrict access to security functions through the use of access control mechanisms and by 
implementing least privilege capabilities. While the ideal is for all of the code within the security 
function isolation boundary to only contain security-relevant code, it is sometimes necessary to 
include nonsecurity functions within the isolation boundary as an exception. Related controls: AC-
3, AC-6, SA-4, SA-5, SA-8, SA-13, SC-2, SC-7, SC-39. 
Control Enhancements: 
(1) SECURITY FUNCTION ISOLATION | HARDWARE SEPARATION  
The information system utilizes underlying hardware separation mechanisms to implement 
security function isolation. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Underlying hardware separation mechanisms include, for example, 
hardware ring architectures, commonly implemented within microprocessors, and hardware-
enforced address segmentation used to support logically distinct storage objects with separate 
attributes (i.e., readable, writeable). 
(2) SECURITY FUNCTION ISOLATION | ACCESS / FLOW CONTROL FUNCTIONS  
The information system isolates security functions enforcing access and information flow control 
from nonsecurity functions and from other security functions. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Security function isolation occurs as a result of implementation; the 
functions can still be scanned and monitored. Security functions that are potentially isolated 
from access and flow control enforcement functions include, for example, auditing, intrusion 
detection, and anti-virus functions. 
(3) SECURITY FUNCTION ISOLATION | MINIMIZE NONSECURITY FUNCTIONALITY 
The organization minimizes the number of nonsecurity functions included within the isolation 
boundary containing security functions. 
Supplemental Guidance:  In those instances where it is not feasible to achieve strict isolation of 
nonsecurity functions from security functions, it is necessary to take actions to minimize the 
nonsecurity-relevant functions within the security function boundary. Nonsecurity functions

APPENDIX F-SC   PAGE F-186 
contained within the isolation boundary are considered security-relevant because errors or 
maliciousness in such software, by virtue of being within the boundary, can impact the 
security functions of organizational information systems. The design objective is that the 
specific portions of information systems providing information security are of minimal 
size/complexity. Minimizing the number of nonsecurity functions in the security-relevant 
components of information systems allows designers and implementers to focus only on those 
functions which are necessary to provide the desired security capability (typically access 
enforcement). By minimizing nonsecurity functions within the isolation boundaries, the 
amount of code that must be trusted to enforce security policies is reduced, thus contributing 
to understandability. 
(4) SECURITY FUNCTION ISOLATION | MODULE COUPLING AND COHESIVENESS  
The organization implements security functions as largely independent modules that maximize 
internal cohesiveness within modules and minimize coupling between modules. 
Supplemental Guidance:  The reduction in inter-module interactions helps to constrain security 
functions and to manage complexity. The concepts of coupling and cohesion are important 
with respect to modularity in software design. Coupling refers to the dependencies that one 
module has on other modules. Cohesion refers to the relationship between the different 
functions within a particular module. Good software engineering practices rely on modular 
decomposition, layering, and minimization to reduce and manage complexity, thus producing 
software modules that are highly cohesive and loosely coupled. 
(5) SECURITY FUNCTION ISOLATION | LAYERED STRUCTURES  
The organization implements security functions as a layered structure minimizing interactions 
between layers of the design and avoiding any dependence by lower layers on the functionality or 
correctness of higher layers. 
Supplemental Guidance:  The implementation of layered structures with minimized interactions 
among security functions and non-looping layers (i.e., lower-layer functions do not depend on 
higher-layer functions) further enables the isolation of security functions and management of 
complexity.

SC-4 INFORMATION IN SHARED RESOURCES 
Control:  The information system prevents unauthorized and unintended information transfer via 
shared system resources. 
Supplemental Guidance:  This control prevents information, including encrypted representations of 
information, produced by the actions of prior users/roles (or the actions of processes acting on 
behalf of prior users/roles) from being available to any current users/roles (or current processes) 
that obtain access to shared system resources (e.g., registers, main memory, hard disks) after those 
resources have been released back to information systems. The control of information in shared 
resources is also commonly referred to as object reuse and residual information protection. This 
control does not address: (i) information remanence which refers to residual representation of data 
that has been nominally erased or removed; (ii) covert channels (including storage and/or timing 
channels) where shared resources are manipulated to violate information flow restrictions; or (iii) 
components within information systems for which there are only single users/roles. Related 
controls: AC-3, AC-4, MP-6.

The information system prevents unauthorized information transfer via shared resources in 
accordance with [Assignment: organization-defined procedures] when system processing 
explicitly switches between different information classification levels or security categories. 
Supplemental Guidance:  This control enhancement applies when there are explicit changes in 
information processing levels during information system operations, for example, during 
multilevel processing and periods processing with information at different classification levels 
or security categories. Organization-defined procedures may include, for example, approved 
sanitization processes for electronically stored information.

SC-5 DENIAL OF SERVICE PROTECTION 
Control:  The information system protects against or limits the effects of the following types of 
denial of service attacks: [Assignment: organization-defined types of denial of service attacks or 
reference to source for such information] by employing [Assignment: organization-defined 
security safeguards]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  A variety of technologies exist to limit, or in some cases, eliminate the 
effects of denial of service attacks. For example, boundary protection devices can filter certain 
types of packets to protect information system components on internal organizational networks 
from being directly affected by denial of service attacks. Employing increased capacity and 
bandwidth combined with service redundancy may also reduce the susceptibility to denial of 
service attacks. Related controls: SC-6, SC-7. 
Control Enhancements: 
(1) DENIAL OF SERVICE PROTECTION | RESTRICT INTERNAL USERS  
The information system restricts the ability of individuals to launch [Assignment: organization-
defined denial of service attacks] against other information systems. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Restricting the ability of individuals to launch denial of service attacks 
requires that the mechanisms used for such attacks are unavailable. Individuals of concern can 
include, for example, hostile insiders or external adversaries that have successfully breached 
the information system and are using the system as a platform to launch cyber attacks on third 
parties. Organizations can restrict the ability of individuals to connect and transmit arbitrary 
information on the transport medium (i.e., network, wireless spectrum). Organizations can 
also limit the ability of individuals to use excessive information system resources. Protection 
against individuals having the ability to launch denial of service attacks may be implemented 
on specific information systems or on boundary devices prohibiting egress to potential target 
systems. 
(2) DENIAL OF SERVICE PROTECTION | EXCESS CAPACITY / BANDWIDTH / REDUNDANCY  
The information system manages excess capacity, bandwidth, or other redundancy to limit the 
effects of information flooding denial of service attacks. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Managing excess capacity ensures that sufficient capacity is available 
to counter flooding attacks. Managing excess capacity may include, for example, establishing 
selected usage priorities, quotas, or partitioning. 
(3) DENIAL OF SERVICE PROTECTION | DETECTION / MONITORING  
The organization: 
(a) Employs [Assignment: organization-defined monitoring tools] to detect indicators of denial of 
service attacks against the information system; and

(b) Monitors [Assignment: organization-defined information system resources] to determine if 
sufficient resources exist to prevent effective denial of service attacks. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Organizations consider utilization and capacity of information system 
resources when managing risk from denial of service due to malicious attacks. Denial of 
service attacks can originate from external or internal sources. Information system resources 
sensitive to denial of service include, for example, physical disk storage, memory, and CPU 
cycles. Common safeguards to prevent denial of service attacks related to storage utilization 
and capacity include, for example, instituting disk quotas, configuring information systems to 
automatically alert administrators when specific storage capacity thresholds are reached, using 
file compression technologies to maximize available storage space, and imposing separate 
partitions for system and user data. Related controls: CA-7, SI-4.

SC-6 RESOURCE AVAILABILITY 
Control:  The information system protects the availability of resources by allocating [Assignment: 
organization-defined resources] by [Selection (one or more); priority; quota; [Assignment: 
organization-defined security safeguards]]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Priority protection helps prevent lower-priority processes from delaying or 
interfering with the information system servicing any higher-priority processes. Quotas prevent 
users or processes from obtaining more than predetermined amounts of resources. This control 
does not apply to information system components for which there are only single users/roles.

SC-7  BOUNDARY PROTECTION 
Control:  The information system: 
a. Monitors and controls communications at the external boundary of the system and at key 
internal boundaries within the system; 
b. Implements subnetworks for publicly accessible system components that are [Selection: 
physically; logically] separated from internal organizational networks; and 
c. Connects to external networks or information systems only through managed interfaces 
consisting of boundary protection devices arranged in accordance with an organizational 
security architecture. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Managed interfaces include, for example, gateways, routers, firewalls, 
guards, network-based malicious code analysis and virtualization systems, or encrypted tunnels 
implemented within a security architecture (e.g., routers protecting firewalls or application 
gateways residing on protected subnetworks). Subnetworks that are physically or logically 
separated from internal networks are referred to as demilitarized zones or DMZs. Restricting or 
prohibiting interfaces within organizational information systems includes, for example, restricting 
external web traffic to designated web servers within managed interfaces and prohibiting external

traffic that appears to be spoofing internal addresses. Organizations consider the shared nature of 
commercial telecommunications services in the implementation of security controls associated 
with the use of such services. Commercial telecommunications services are commonly based on 
network components and consolidated management systems shared by all attached commercial 
customers, and may also include third party-provided access lines and other service elements. 
Such transmission services may represent sources of increased risk despite contract security 
provisions. Related controls: AC-4, AC-17, CA-3, CM-7, CP-8, IR-4, RA-3, SC-5, SC-13.

[Withdrawn: Incorporated into SC-7]. 
(2) BOUNDARY PROTECTION | PUBLIC ACCESS 
[Withdrawn: Incorporated into SC-7]. 
(3) BOUNDARY PROTECTION | ACCESS POINTS  
The organization limits the number of external network connections to the information system. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Limiting the number of external network connections facilitates more 
comprehensive monitoring of inbound and outbound communications traffic. The Trusted 
Internet Connection (TIC) initiative is an example of limiting the number of external network 
connections. 
(4) BOUNDARY PROTECTION | EXTERNAL TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES  
The organization: 
(a) Implements a managed interface for each external telecommunication service; 
(b) Establishes a traffic flow policy for each managed interface; 
(c) Protects the confidentiality and integrity of the information being transmitted across each 
interface; 
(d) Documents each exception to the traffic flow policy with a supporting mission/business need 
and duration of that need; and 
(e) Reviews exceptions to the traffic flow policy [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] 
and removes exceptions that are no longer supported by an explicit mission/business need. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Related control: SC-8. 
(5) BOUNDARY PROTECTION | DENY BY DEFAULT / ALLOW BY EXCEPTION  
The information system at managed interfaces denies network communications traffic by default 
and allows network communications traffic by exception (i.e., deny all, permit by exception). 
Supplemental Guidance:  This control enhancement applies to both inbound and outbound 
network communications traffic. A deny-all, permit-by-exception network communications 
traffic policy ensures that only those connections which are essential and approved are 
allowed. 
(6) BOUNDARY PROTECTION | RESPONSE TO RECOGNIZED FAILURES  
[Withdrawn: Incorporated into SC-7 (18)]. 
(7) BOUNDARY PROTECTION | PREVENT SPLIT TUNNELING FOR REMOTE DEVICES  
The information system, in conjunction with a remote device, prevents the device from 
simultaneously establishing non-remote connections with the system and communicating via 
some other connection to resources in external networks. 
Supplemental Guidance:  This control enhancement is implemented within remote devices (e.g., 
notebook computers) through configuration settings to disable split tunneling in those devices, 
and by preventing those configuration settings from being readily configurable by users. This 
control enhancement is implemented within the information system by the detection of split 
tunneling (or of configuration settings that allow split tunneling) in the remote device, and by 
prohibiting the connection if the remote device is using split tunneling. Split tunneling might 
be desirable by remote users to communicate with local information system resources such as 
printers/file servers. However, split tunneling would in effect allow unauthorized external 
connections, making the system more vulnerable to attack and to exfiltration of organizational

information. The use of VPNs for remote connections, when adequately provisioned with 
appropriate security controls, may provide the organization with sufficient assurance that it 
can effectively treat such connections as non-remote connections from the confidentiality and 
integrity perspective. VPNs thus provide a means for allowing non-remote communications 
paths from remote devices. The use of an adequately provisioned VPN does not eliminate the 
need for preventing split tunneling. 
(8) BOUNDARY PROTECTION | ROUTE TRAFFIC TO AUTHENTICATED PROXY SERVERS  
The information system routes [Assignment: organization-defined internal communications traffic] 
to [Assignment: organization-defined external networks] through authenticated proxy servers at 
managed interfaces. 
Supplemental Guidance:  External networks are networks outside of organizational control. A 
proxy server is a server (i.e., information system or application) that acts as an intermediary 
for clients requesting information system resources (e.g., files, connections, web pages, or 
services) from other organizational servers. Client requests established through an initial 
connection to the proxy server are evaluated to manage complexity and to provide additional 
protection by limiting direct connectivity. Web content filtering devices are one of the most 
common proxy servers providing access to the Internet. Proxy servers support logging 
individual Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) sessions and blocking specific Uniform 
Resource Locators (URLs), domain names, and Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Web proxies 
can be configured with organization-defined lists of authorized and unauthorized websites. 
Related controls: AC-3, AU-2. 
(9) BOUNDARY PROTECTION | RESTRICT THREATENING OUTGOING COMMUNICATIONS TRAFFIC  
The information system: 
(a) Detects and denies outgoing communications traffic posing a threat to external information 
systems; and 
(b) Audits the identity of internal users associated with denied communications. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Detecting outgoing communications traffic from internal actions that 
may pose threats to external information systems is sometimes termed extrusion detection. 
Extrusion detection at information system boundaries as part of managed interfaces includes 
the analysis of incoming and outgoing communications traffic searching for indications of 
internal threats to the security of external systems. Such threats include, for example, traffic 
indicative of denial of service attacks and traffic containing malicious code. Related controls: 
AU-2, AU-6, SC-38, SC-44, SI-3, SI-4. 
(10) BOUNDARY PROTECTION | PREVENT UNAUTHORIZED EXFILTRATION  
The organization prevents the unauthorized exfiltration of information across managed interfaces. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Safeguards implemented by organizations to prevent unauthorized 
exfiltration of information from information systems include, for example: (i) strict adherence 
to protocol formats; (ii) monitoring for beaconing from information systems; (iii) monitoring 
for steganography; (iv) disconnecting external network interfaces except when explicitly 
needed; (v) disassembling and reassembling packet headers; and (vi) employing traffic profile 
analysis to detect deviations from the volume/types of traffic expected within organizations or 
call backs to command and control centers. Devices enforcing strict adherence to protocol 
formats include, for example, deep packet inspection firewalls and XML gateways. These 
devices verify adherence to protocol formats and specification at the application layer and 
serve to identify vulnerabilities that cannot be detected by devices operating at the network or 
transport layers. This control enhancement is closely associated with cross-domain solutions 
and system guards enforcing information flow requirements. Related control: SI-3. 
(11) BOUNDARY PROTECTION | RESTRICT INCOMING COMMUNICATIONS TRAFFIC  
The information system only allows incoming communications from [Assignment: organization-
defined authorized sources] routed to [Assignment: organization-defined authorized destinations]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  This control enhancement provides determinations that source and 
destination address pairs represent authorized/allowed communications. Such determinations 
can be based on several factors including, for example, the presence of source/destination

address pairs in lists of authorized/allowed communications, the absence of address pairs in 
lists of unauthorized/disallowed pairs, or meeting more general rules for authorized/allowed 
source/destination pairs. Related control: AC-3. 
(12) BOUNDARY PROTECTION | HOST-BASED PROTECTION  
The organization implements [Assignment: organization-defined host-based boundary protection 
mechanisms] at [Assignment: organization-defined information system components]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Host-based boundary protection mechanisms include, for example, 
host-based firewalls. Information system components employing host-based boundary 
protection mechanisms include, for example, servers, workstations, and mobile devices. 
(13) BOUNDARY PROTECTION | ISOLATION OF SECURITY TOOLS / MECHANISMS / SUPPORT COMPONENTS  
The organization isolates [Assignment: organization-defined information security tools, 
mechanisms, and support components] from other internal information system components by 
implementing physically separate subnetworks with managed interfaces to other components of 
the system. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Physically separate subnetworks with managed interfaces are useful, 
for example, in isolating computer network defenses from critical operational processing 
networks to prevent adversaries from discovering the analysis and forensics techniques of 
organizations. Related controls: SA-8, SC-2, SC-3. 
(14) BOUNDARY PROTECTION | PROTECTS AGAINST UNAUTHORIZED PHYSICAL CONNECTIONS  
The organization protects against unauthorized physical connections at [Assignment: 
organization-defined managed interfaces]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Information systems operating at different security categories or 
classification levels may share common physical and environmental controls, since the 
systems may share space within organizational facilities. In practice, it is possible that these 
separate information systems may share common equipment rooms, wiring closets, and cable 
distribution paths. Protection against unauthorized physical connections can be achieved, for 
example, by employing clearly identified and physically separated cable trays, connection 
frames, and patch panels for each side of managed interfaces with physical access controls 
enforcing limited authorized access to these items. Related controls: PE-4, PE-19. 
(15) BOUNDARY PROTECTION | ROUTE PRIVILEGED NETWORK ACCESSES  
The information system routes all networked, privileged accesses through a dedicated, managed 
interface for purposes of access control and auditing. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Related controls: AC-2, AC-3, AU-2, SI-4. 
(16) BOUNDARY PROTECTION | PREVENT DISCOVERY OF COMPONENTS / DEVICES  
The information system prevents discovery of specific system components composing a managed 
interface. 
Supplemental Guidance:  This control enhancement protects network addresses of information 
system components that are part of managed interfaces from discovery through common tools 
and techniques used to identify devices on networks. Network addresses are not available for 
discovery (e.g., network address not published or entered in domain name systems), requiring 
prior knowledge for access. Another obfuscation technique is to periodically change network 
addresses. 
(17) BOUNDARY PROTECTION | AUTOMATED ENFORCEMENT OF PROTOCOL FORMATS  
The information system enforces adherence to protocol formats. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Information system components that enforce protocol formats include, 
for example, deep packet inspection firewalls and XML gateways. Such system components 
verify adherence to protocol formats/specifications (e.g., IEEE) at the application layer and 
identify significant vulnerabilities that cannot be detected by devices operating at the network 
or transport layers. Related control: SC-4. 
(18) BOUNDARY PROTECTION | FAIL SECURE  
The information system fails securely in the event of an operational failure of a boundary 
protection device.

________________________________________________________________________________________________ 
APPENDIX F-SC   PAGE F-192 
Supplemental Guidance:  Fail secure is a condition achieved by employing information system 
mechanisms to ensure that in the event of operational failures of boundary protection devices 
at managed interfaces (e.g., routers, firewalls, guards, and application gateways residing on 
protected subnetworks commonly referred to as demilitarized zones), information systems do 
not enter into unsecure states where intended security properties no longer hold. Failures of 
boundary protection devices cannot lead to, or cause information external to the devices to 
enter the devices, nor can failures permit unauthorized information releases. Related controls: 
CP-2, SC-24. 
(19) BOUNDARY PROTECTION | BLOCKS COMMUNICATION FROM NON-ORGANIZATIONALLY CONFIGURED HOSTS 
The information system blocks both inbound and outbound communications traffic between 
[Assignment: organization-defined communication clients] that are independently configured by 
end users and external service providers. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Communication clients independently configured by end users and 
external service providers include, for example, instant messaging clients. Traffic blocking 
does not apply to communication clients that are configured by organizations to perform 
authorized functions. 
(20) BOUNDARY PROTECTION | DYNAMIC ISOLATION / SEGREGATION  
The information system provides the capability to dynamically isolate/segregate [Assignment: 
organization-defined information system components] from other components of the system. 
Supplemental Guidance:  The capability to dynamically isolate or segregate certain internal 
components of organizational information systems is useful when it is necessary to partition 
or separate certain components of dubious origin from those components possessing greater 
trustworthiness. Component isolation reduces the attack surface of organizational information 
systems. Isolation of selected information system components is also a means of limiting the 
damage from successful cyber attacks when those attacks occur. 
(21) BOUNDARY PROTECTION | ISOLATION OF INFORMATION SYSTEM COMPONENTS  
The organization employs boundary protection mechanisms to separate [Assignment: 
organization-defined information system components] supporting [Assignment: organization-
defined missions and/or business functions]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Organizations can isolate information system components performing 
different missions and/or business functions. Such isolation limits unauthorized information 
flows among system components and also provides the opportunity to deploy greater levels of 
protection for selected components. Separating system components with boundary protection 
mechanisms provides the capability for increased protection of individual components and to 
more effectively control information flows between those components. This type of enhanced 
protection limits the potential harm from cyber attacks and errors. The degree of separation 
provided varies depending upon the mechanisms chosen. Boundary protection mechanisms 
include, for example, routers, gateways, and firewalls separating system components into 
physically separate networks or subnetworks, cross-domain devices separating subnetworks, 
virtualization techniques, and encrypting information flows among system components using 
distinct encryption keys. Related controls: CA-9, SC-3.  
(22) BOUNDARY PROTECTION | SEPARATE SUBNETS FOR CONNECTING TO DIFFERENT SECURITY DOMAINS  
The information system implements separate network addresses (i.e., different subnets) to connect 
to systems in different security domains. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Decomposition of information systems into subnets helps to provide 
the appropriate level of protection for network connections to different security domains 
containing information with different security categories or classification levels.  
(23) BOUNDARY PROTECTION | DISABLE SENDER FEEDBACK ON PROTOCOL VALIDATION FAILURE  
The information system disables feedback to senders on protocol format validation failure. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Disabling feedback to senders when there is a failure in protocol 
validation format prevents adversaries from obtaining information which would otherwise be 
unavailable.

SC-8 TRANSMISSION CONFIDENTIALITY AND INTEGRITY 
Control:  The information system protects the [Selection (one or more): confidentiality; integrity] of 
transmitted information. 
Supplemental Guidance:  This control applies to both internal and external networks and all types of 
information system components from which information can be transmitted (e.g., servers, mobile 
devices, notebook computers, printers, copiers, scanners, facsimile machines). Communication 
paths outside the physical protection of a controlled boundary are exposed to the possibility of 
interception and modification. Protecting the confidentiality and/or integrity of organizational 
information can be accomplished by physical means (e.g., by employing physical distribution 
systems) or by logical means (e.g., employing encryption techniques). Organizations relying on 
commercial providers offering transmission services as commodity services rather than as fully 
dedicated services (i.e., services which can be highly specialized to individual customer needs), 
may find it difficult to obtain the necessary assurances regarding the implementation of needed 
security controls for transmission confidentiality/integrity. In such situations, organizations 
determine what types of confidentiality/integrity services are available in standard, commercial 
telecommunication service packages. If it is infeasible or impractical to obtain the necessary 
security controls and assurances of control effectiveness through appropriate contracting vehicles, 
organizations implement appropriate compensating security controls or explicitly accept the 
additional risk. Related controls: AC-17, PE-4. 
Control Enhancements: 
(1) TRANSMISSION CONFIDENTIALITY AND INTEGRITY | CRYPTOGRAPHIC OR ALTERNATE PHYSICAL PROTECTION  
The information system implements cryptographic mechanisms to [Selection (one or more): 
prevent unauthorized disclosure of information; detect changes to information] during 
transmission unless otherwise protected by [Assignment: organization-defined alternative physical 
safeguards]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Encrypting information for transmission protects information from 
unauthorized disclosure and modification. Cryptographic mechanisms implemented to protect 
information integrity include, for example, cryptographic hash functions which have common 
application in digital signatures, checksums, and message authentication codes. Alternative 
physical security safeguards include, for example, protected distribution systems. Related 
control: SC-13. 
(2) TRANSMISSION CONFIDENTIALITY AND INTEGRITY | PRE / POST TRANSMISSION HANDLING 
The information system maintains the [Selection (one or more): confidentiality; integrity] of 
information during preparation for transmission and during reception. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Information can be either unintentionally or maliciously disclosed or 
modified during preparation for transmission or during reception including, for example, 
during aggregation, at protocol transformation points, and during packing/unpacking. These 
unauthorized disclosures or modifications compromise the confidentiality or integrity of the 
information. Related control: AU-10. 
(3) TRANSMISSION CONFIDENTIALITY AND INTEGRITY | CRYPTOGRAPHIC PROTECTION FOR MESSAGE EXTERNALS  
The information system implements cryptographic mechanisms to protect message externals 
unless otherwise protected by [Assignment: organization-defined alternative physical safeguards]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  This control enhancement addresses protection against unauthorized 
disclosure of information. Message externals include, for example, message headers/routing 
information. This control enhancement prevents the exploitation of message externals and 
applies to both internal and external networks or links that may be visible to individuals who 
are not authorized users. Header/routing information is sometimes transmitted unencrypted 
because the information is not properly identified by organizations as having significant value

or because encrypting the information can result in lower network performance and/or higher 
costs. Alternative physical safeguards include, for example, protected distribution systems. 
Related controls: SC-12, SC-13. 
(4) TRANSMISSION CONFIDENTIALITY AND INTEGRITY | CONCEAL / RANDOMIZE COMMUNICATIONS 
The information system implements cryptographic mechanisms to conceal or randomize 
communication patterns unless otherwise protected by [Assignment: organization-defined 
alternative physical safeguards]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  This control enhancement addresses protection against unauthorized 
disclosure of information. Communication patterns include, for example, frequency, periods, 
amount, and predictability. Changes to communications patterns can reveal information 
having intelligence value especially when combined with other available information related 
to missions/business functions supported by organizational information systems. This control 
enhancement prevents the derivation of intelligence based on communications patterns and 
applies to both internal and external networks or links that may be visible to individuals who 
are not authorized users. Encrypting the links and transmitting in continuous, fixed/random 
patterns prevents the derivation of intelligence from the system communications patterns. 
Alternative physical safeguards include, for example, protected distribution systems. Related 
controls: SC-12, SC-13.

Control:  The information system terminates the network connection associated with a 
communications session at the end of the session or after [Assignment: organization-defined time 
period] of inactivity.  
Supplemental Guidance:  This control applies to both internal and external networks. Terminating 
network connections associated with communications sessions include, for example, de-allocating 
associated TCP/IP address/port pairs at the operating system level, or de-allocating networking 
assignments at the application level if multiple application sessions are using a single, operating 
system-level network connection. Time periods of inactivity may be established by organizations 
and include, for example, time periods by type of network access or for specific network accesses.

SC-11 TRUSTED PATH 
Control:  The information system establishes a trusted communications path between the user and 
the following security functions of the system: [Assignment: organization-defined security 
functions to include at a minimum, information system authentication and re-authentication].  
Supplemental Guidance:  Trusted paths are mechanisms by which users (through input devices) can 
communicate directly with security functions of information systems with the requisite assurance 
to support information security policies. The mechanisms can be activated only by users or the 
security functions of organizational information systems. User responses via trusted paths are 
protected from modifications by or disclosure to untrusted applications. Organizations employ 
trusted paths for high-assurance connections between security functions of information systems 
and users (e.g., during system logons). Enforcement of trusted communications paths is typically 
provided via an implementation that meets the reference monitor concept. Related controls: AC-
16, AC-25.

SC-12 CRYPTOGRAPHIC KEY ESTABLISHMENT AND MANAGEMENT 
Control:  The organization establishes and manages cryptographic keys for required cryptography 
employed within the information system in accordance with [Assignment: organization-defined 
requirements for key generation, distribution, storage, access, and destruction]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Cryptographic key management and establishment can be performed using 
manual procedures or automated mechanisms with supporting manual procedures. Organizations 
define key management requirements in accordance with applicable federal laws, Executive 
Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidance, specifying appropriate options, 
levels, and parameters. Organizations manage trust stores to ensure that only approved trust 
anchors are in such trust stores. This includes certificates with visibility external to organizational 
information systems and certificates related to the internal operations of systems. Related controls: 
SC-13, SC-17. 
Control Enhancements: 
(1) CRYPTOGRAPHIC KEY ESTABLISHMENT AND MANAGEMENT | AVAILABILITY  
The organization maintains availability of information in the event of the loss of cryptographic keys 
by users. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Escrowing of encryption keys is a common practice for ensuring 
availability in the event of loss of keys (e.g., due to forgotten passphrase). 
(2) CRYPTOGRAPHIC KEY ESTABLISHMENT AND MANAGEMENT | SYMMETRIC KEYS  
The organization produces, controls, and distributes symmetric cryptographic keys using 
[Selection: NIST FIPS-compliant; NSA-approved] key management technology and processes. 
(3) CRYPTOGRAPHIC KEY ESTABLISHMENT AND MANAGEMENT | ASYMMETRIC KEYS  
The organization produces, controls, and distributes asymmetric cryptographic keys using 
[Selection: NSA-approved key management technology and processes; approved PKI Class 3 
certificates or prepositioned keying material; approved PKI Class 3 or Class 4 certificates and 
hardware security tokens that protect the user’s private key].

SC-13 CRYPTOGRAPHIC PROTECTION 
Control:  The information system implements [Assignment: organization-defined cryptographic 
uses and type of cryptography required for each use] in accordance with applicable federal laws, 
Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, and standards. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Cryptography can be employed to support a variety of security solutions 
including, for example, the protection of classified and Controlled Unclassified Information, the 
provision of digital signatures, and the enforcement of information separation when authorized 
individuals have the necessary clearances for such information but lack the necessary formal 
access approvals. Cryptography can also be used to support random number generation and hash 
generation. Generally applicable cryptographic standards include FIPS-validated cryptography and 
NSA-approved cryptography. This control does not impose any requirements on organizations to 
use cryptography. However, if cryptography is required based on the selection of other security 
controls, organizations define each type of cryptographic use and the type of cryptography 
required (e.g., protection of classified information: NSA-approved cryptography; provision of 
digital signatures: FIPS-validated cryptography). Related controls: AC-2, AC-3, AC-7, AC-17,

Control:  The information system: 
a. Prohibits remote activation of collaborative computing devices with the following exceptions: 
[Assignment: organization-defined exceptions where remote activation is to be allowed]; and 
b. Provides an explicit indication of use to users physically present at the devices. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Collaborative computing devices include, for example, networked white 
boards, cameras, and microphones. Explicit indication of use includes, for example, signals to 
users when collaborative computing devices are activated. Related control: AC-21. 
Control Enhancements: 
(1) COLLABORATIVE COMPUTING DEVICES | PHYSICAL DISCONNECT  
The information system provides physical disconnect of collaborative computing devices in a 
manner that supports ease of use. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Failing to physically disconnect from collaborative computing devices 
can result in subsequent compromises of organizational information. Providing easy methods 
to physically disconnect from such devices after a collaborative computing session helps to 
ensure that participants actually carry out the disconnect activity without having to go through 
complex and tedious procedures.

SC-18 MOBILE CODE 
Control:  The organization: 
a. Defines acceptable and unacceptable mobile code and mobile code technologies; 
b. Establishes usage restrictions and implementation guidance for acceptable mobile code and 
mobile code technologies; and 
c. Authorizes, monitors, and controls the use of mobile code within the information system. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Decisions regarding the employment of mobile code within organizational 
information systems are based on the potential for the code to cause damage to the systems if used 
maliciously. Mobile code technologies include, for example, Java, JavaScript, ActiveX, Postscript, 
PDF, Shockwave movies, Flash animations, and VBScript. Usage restrictions and implementation 
guidance apply to both the selection and use of mobile code installed on servers and mobile code 
downloaded and executed on individual workstations and devices (e.g., smart phones). Mobile 
code policy and procedures address preventing the development, acquisition, or introduction of 
unacceptable mobile code within organizational information systems. Related controls: AU-2, 
AU-12, CM-2, CM-6, SI-3. 
Control Enhancements: 
(1) MOBILE CODE | IDENTIFY UNACCEPTABLE CODE / TAKE CORRECTIVE ACTIONS  
The information system identifies [Assignment: organization-defined unacceptable mobile code] 
and takes [Assignment: organization-defined corrective actions]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Corrective actions when unacceptable mobile code is detected include, 
for example, blocking, quarantine, or alerting administrators. Blocking includes, for example, 
preventing transmission of word processing files with embedded macros when such macros 
have been defined to be unacceptable mobile code.

The information system prevents the automatic execution of mobile code in [Assignment: 
organization-defined software applications] and enforces [Assignment: organization-defined 
actions] prior to executing the code. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Actions enforced before executing mobile code, include, for example, 
prompting users prior to opening electronic mail attachments. Preventing automatic execution 
of mobile code includes, for example, disabling auto execute features on information system 
components employing portable storage devices such as Compact Disks (CDs), Digital Video

Supplemental Guidance:  This control enables external clients including, for example, remote 
Internet clients, to obtain origin authentication and integrity verification assurances for the 
host/service name to network address resolution information obtained through the service. 
Information systems that provide name and address resolution services include, for example, 
domain name system (DNS) servers. Additional artifacts include, for example, DNS Security 
(DNSSEC) digital signatures and cryptographic keys. DNS resource records are examples of 
authoritative data. The means to indicate the security status of child zones includes, for example, 
the use of delegation signer resource records in the DNS. The DNS security controls reflect (and 
are referenced from) OMB Memorandum 08-23. Information systems that use technologies other 
than the DNS to map between host/service names and network addresses provide other means to

Supplemental Guidance:  Each client of name resolution services either performs this validation on 
its own, or has authenticated channels to trusted validation providers. Information systems that 
provide name and address resolution services for local clients include, for example, recursive 
resolving or caching domain name system (DNS) servers. DNS client resolvers either perform 
validation of DNSSEC signatures, or clients use authenticated channels to recursive resolvers that 
perform such validations. Information systems that use technologies other than the DNS to map 
between host/service names and network addresses provide other means to enable clients to verify 
the authenticity and integrity of response data. Related controls: SC-20, SC-22.

Supplemental Guidance:  Information systems that provide name and address resolution services 
include, for example, domain name system (DNS) servers. To eliminate single points of failure 
and to enhance redundancy, organizations employ at least two authoritative domain name system 
servers, one configured as the primary server and the other configured as the secondary server. 
Additionally, organizations typically deploy the servers in two geographically separated network 
subnetworks (i.e., not located in the same physical facility). For role separation, DNS servers with 
internal roles only process name and address resolution requests from within organizations (i.e., 
from internal clients). DNS servers with external roles only process name and address resolution 
information requests from clients external to organizations (i.e., on external networks including 
the Internet). Organizations specify clients that can access authoritative DNS servers in particular 
roles (e.g., by address ranges, explicit lists). Related controls: SC-2, SC-20, SC-21, SC-24.

SC-23 SESSION AUTHENTICITY 
Control:  The information system protects the authenticity of communications sessions. 
Supplemental Guidance:  This control addresses communications protection at the session, versus 
packet level (e.g., sessions in service-oriented architectures providing web-based services) and 
establishes grounds for confidence at both ends of communications sessions in ongoing identities 
of other parties and in the validity of information transmitted. Authenticity protection includes, for 
example, protecting against man-in-the-middle attacks/session hijacking and the insertion of false 
information into sessions. Related controls: SC-8, SC-10, SC-11. 
Control Enhancements: 
(1) SESSION AUTHENTICITY | INVALIDATE SESSION IDENTIFIERS AT LOGOUT  
The information system invalidates session identifiers upon user logout or other session

system-generated. 
Supplemental Guidance:  This control enhancement curtails the ability of adversaries from 
reusing previously valid session IDs. Employing the concept of randomness in the generation 
of unique session identifiers helps to protect against brute-force attacks to determine future 
session identifiers. Related control: SC-13.

Control:  The information system fails to a [Assignment: organization-defined known-state] for 
[Assignment: organization-defined types of failures] preserving [Assignment: organization-defined 
system state information] in failure. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Failure in a known state addresses security concerns in accordance with the 
mission/business needs of organizations. Failure in a known secure state helps to prevent the loss 
of confidentiality, integrity, or availability of information in the event of failures of organizational 
information systems or system components. Failure in a known safe state helps to prevent systems 
from failing to a state that may cause injury to individuals or destruction to property. Preserving 
information system state information facilitates system restart and return to the operational mode 
of organizations with less disruption of mission/business processes. Related controls: CP-2, CP-

SC-28 PROTECTION OF INFORMATION AT REST 
Control:  The information system protects the [Selection (one or more): confidentiality; integrity] of 
[Assignment: organization-defined information at rest]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  This control addresses the confidentiality and integrity of information at 
rest and covers user information and system information. Information at rest refers to the state of 
information when it is located on storage devices as specific components of information systems. 
System-related information requiring protection includes, for example, configurations or rule sets 
for firewalls, gateways, intrusion detection/prevention systems, filtering routers, and authenticator 
content. Organizations may employ different mechanisms to achieve confidentiality and integrity 
protections, including the use of cryptographic mechanisms and file share scanning. Integrity 
protection can be achieved, for example, by implementing Write-Once-Read-Many (WORM) 
technologies. Organizations may also employ other security controls including, for example, 
secure off-line storage in lieu of online storage when adequate protection of information at rest 
cannot otherwise be achieved and/or continuous monitoring to identify malicious code at rest. 
Related controls: AC-3, AC-6, CA-7, CM-3, CM-5, CM-6, PE-3, SC-8, SC-13, SI-3, SI-7. 
Control Enhancements: 
(1) PROTECTION OF INFORMATION AT REST | CRYPTOGRAPHIC PROTECTION  
The information system implements cryptographic mechanisms to prevent unauthorized 
disclosure and modification of [Assignment: organization-defined information] on [Assignment: 
organization-defined information system components].

________________________________________________________________________________________________ 
APPENDIX F-SC   PAGE F-204 
Supplemental Guidance:  Selection of cryptographic mechanisms is based on the need to protect 
the confidentiality and integrity of organizational information. The strength of mechanism is 
commensurate with the security category and/or classification of the information. This control 
enhancement applies to significant concentrations of digital media in organizational areas 
designated for media storage and also to limited quantities of media generally associated with 
information system components in operational environments (e.g., portable storage devices, 
mobile devices). Organizations have the flexibility to either encrypt all information on storage 
devices (i.e., full disk encryption) or encrypt specific data structures (e.g., files, records, or 
fields). Organizations employing cryptographic mechanisms to protect information at rest also 
consider cryptographic key management solutions. Related controls: AC-19, SC-12. 
(2) PROTECTION OF INFORMATION AT REST  | OFF-LINE STORAGE 
The organization removes from online storage and stores off-line in a secure location [Assignment: 
organization-defined information]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Removing organizational information from online information system 
storage to off-line storage eliminates the possibility of individuals gaining unauthorized 
access to the information through a network. Therefore, organizations may choose to move 
information to off-line storage in lieu of protecting such information in online storage.

SC-29 HETEROGENEITY 
 Control:  The organization employs a diverse set of information technologies for [Assignment: 
organization-defined information system components] in the implementation of the information 
system. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Increasing the diversity of information technologies within organizational 
information systems reduces the impact of potential exploitations of specific technologies and also 
defends against common mode failures, including those failures induced by supply chain attacks. 
Diversity in information technologies also reduces the likelihood that the means adversaries use to 
compromise one information system component will be equally effective against other system 
components, thus further increasing the adversary work factor to successfully complete planned 
cyber attacks. An increase in diversity may add complexity and management overhead which 
could ultimately lead to mistakes and unauthorized configurations. Related controls: SA-12, SA-
14, SC-27. 
Control Enhancements: 
(1) HETEROGENEITY | VIRTUALIZATION TECHNIQUES  
The organization employs virtualization techniques to support the deployment of a diversity of 
operating systems and applications that are changed [Assignment: organization-defined 
frequency]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  While frequent changes to operating systems and applications pose 
configuration management challenges, the changes can result in an increased work factor for 
adversaries in order to carry out successful cyber attacks. Changing virtual operating systems 
or applications, as opposed to changing actual operating systems/applications, provide virtual 
changes that impede attacker success while reducing configuration management efforts. In 
addition, virtualization techniques can assist organizations in isolating untrustworthy software 
and/or software of dubious provenance into confined execution environments.

SC-30 CONCEALMENT AND MISDIRECTION 
Control:  The organization employs [Assignment: organization-defined concealment and 
misdirection techniques] for [Assignment: organization-defined information systems] at 
[Assignment: organization-defined time periods] to confuse and mislead adversaries. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Concealment and misdirection techniques can significantly reduce the 
targeting capability of adversaries (i.e., window of opportunity and available attack surface) to 
initiate and complete cyber attacks. For example, virtualization techniques provide organizations 
with the ability to disguise information systems, potentially reducing the likelihood of successful 
attacks without the cost of having multiple platforms. Increased use of concealment/misdirection 
techniques including, for example, randomness, uncertainty, and virtualization, may sufficiently 
confuse and mislead adversaries and subsequently increase the risk of discovery and/or exposing 
tradecraft. Concealment/misdirection techniques may also provide organizations additional time to 
successfully perform core missions and business functions. Because of the time and effort required 
to support concealment/misdirection techniques, it is anticipated that such techniques would be 
used by organizations on a very limited basis. Related controls: SC-26, SC-29, SI-14. 
Control Enhancements:   
(1) CONCEALMENT AND MISDIRECTION | VIRTUALIZATION TECHNIQUES  
[Withdrawn: Incorporated into SC-29 (1)].  
(2) CONCEALMENT AND MISDIRECTION | RANDOMNESS  
The organization employs [Assignment: organization-defined techniques] to introduce 
randomness into organizational operations and assets. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Randomness introduces increased levels of uncertainty for adversaries 
regarding the actions organizations take in defending against cyber attacks. Such actions may 
impede the ability of adversaries to correctly target information resources of organizations 
supporting critical missions/business functions. Uncertainty may also cause adversaries to 
hesitate before initiating or continuing attacks. Misdirection techniques involving randomness 
include, for example, performing certain routine actions at different times of day, employing 
different information technologies (e.g., browsers, search engines), using different suppliers, 
and rotating roles and responsibilities of organizational personnel. 
(3) CONCEALMENT AND MISDIRECTION | CHANGE PROCESSING / STORAGE LOCATIONS  
The organization changes the location of [Assignment: organization-defined processing and/or 
storage] [Selection: [Assignment: organization-defined time frequency]; at random time intervals]]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Adversaries target critical organizational missions/business functions 
and the information resources supporting those missions and functions while at the same time, 
trying to minimize exposure of their existence and tradecraft. The static, homogeneous, and 
deterministic nature of organizational information systems targeted by adversaries, make such 
systems more susceptible to cyber attacks with less adversary cost and effort to be successful. 
Changing organizational processing and storage locations (sometimes referred to as moving 
target defense) addresses the advanced persistent threat (APT) using techniques such as 
virtualization, distributed processing, and replication. This enables organizations to relocate 
the information resources (i.e., processing and/or storage) supporting critical missions and 
business functions. Changing locations of processing activities and/or storage sites introduces 
uncertainty into the targeting activities by adversaries. This uncertainty increases the work 
factor of adversaries making compromises or breaches to organizational information systems 
much more difficult and time-consuming, and increases the chances that adversaries may 
inadvertently disclose aspects of tradecraft while attempting to locate critical organizational 
resources.

(4) CONCEALMENT AND MISDIRECTION | MISLEADING INFORMATION  
The organization employs realistic, but misleading information in [Assignment: organization-
defined information system components] with regard to its security state or posture. 
Supplemental Guidance:  This control enhancement misleads potential adversaries regarding the 
nature and extent of security safeguards deployed by organizations. As a result, adversaries 
may employ incorrect (and as a result ineffective) attack techniques. One way of misleading 
adversaries is for organizations to place misleading information regarding the specific security 
controls deployed in external information systems that are known to be accessed or targeted 
by adversaries. Another technique is the use of deception nets (e.g., honeynets, virtualized 
environments) that mimic actual aspects of organizational information systems but use, for 
example, out-of-date software configurations. 
(5) CONCEALMENT AND MISDIRECTION | CONCEALMENT OF SYSTEM COMPONENTS  
The organization employs [Assignment: organization-defined techniques] to hide or conceal 
[Assignment: organization-defined information system components]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  By hiding, disguising, or otherwise concealing critical information 
system components, organizations may be able to decrease the probability that adversaries 
target and successfully compromise those assets. Potential means for organizations to hide 
and/or conceal information system components include, for example, configuration of routers 
or the use of honeynets or virtualization techniques.

SC-31 COVERT CHANNEL ANALYSIS 
Control:  The organization:  
a. Performs a covert channel analysis to identify those aspects of communications within the 
information system that are potential avenues for covert [Selection (one or more): storage; 
timing] channels; and 
b. Estimates the maximum bandwidth of those channels. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Developers are in the best position to identify potential areas within 
systems that might lead to covert channels. Covert channel analysis is a meaningful activity when 
there is the potential for unauthorized information flows across security domains, for example, in 
the case of information systems containing export-controlled information and having connections 
to external networks (i.e., networks not controlled by organizations). Covert channel analysis is 
also meaningful for multilevel secure (MLS) information systems, multiple security level (MSL) 
systems, and cross-domain systems. Related controls: AC-3, AC-4, PL-2. 
Control Enhancements: 
(1) COVERT CHANNEL ANALYSIS | TEST COVERT CHANNELS FOR EXPLOITABILITY

(2) COVERT CHANNEL ANALYSIS | MAXIMUM BANDWIDTH  
The organization reduces the maximum bandwidth for identified covert [Selection (one or more); 
storage; timing] channels to [Assignment: organization-defined values]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Information system developers are in the best position to reduce the 
maximum bandwidth for identified covert storage and timing channels. 
(3) COVERT CHANNEL ANALYSIS | MEASURE BANDWIDTH IN OPERATIONAL ENVIRONMENTS  
The organization measures the bandwidth of [Assignment: organization-defined subset of

Supplemental Guidance:  This control enhancement addresses covert channel bandwidth in 
operational environments versus developmental environments. Measuring covert channel 
bandwidth in operational environments helps organizations to determine how much 
information can be covertly leaked before such leakage adversely affects organizational 
missions/business functions. Covert channel bandwidth may be significantly different when 
measured in those settings that are independent of the particular environments of operation 
(e.g., laboratories or development environments).

 Control:  The organization partitions the information system into [Assignment: organization-defined 
information system components] residing in separate physical domains or environments based on 
[Assignment: organization-defined circumstances for physical separation of components]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Information system partitioning is a part of a defense-in-depth protection 
strategy. Organizations determine the degree of physical separation of system components from 
physically distinct components in separate racks in the same room, to components in separate 
rooms for the more critical components, to more significant geographical separation of the most 
critical components. Security categorization can guide the selection of appropriate candidates for

as read-only media provided: (i) integrity can be adequately protected from the point of initial 
writing to the insertion of the memory into the information system; and (ii) there are reliable 
hardware protections against reprogramming the memory while installed in organizational

Control Enhancements: 
(1) NON-MODIFIABLE EXECUTABLE PROGRAMS | NO WRITABLE STORAGE

Supplemental Guidance:  This control enhancement: (i) eliminates the possibility of malicious 
code insertion via persistent, writeable storage within the designated information system

SC-36 DISTRIBUTED PROCESSING AND STORAGE 
Control:  The organization distributes [Assignment: organization-defined processing and storage] 
across multiple physical locations. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Distributing processing and storage across multiple physical locations 
provides some degree of redundancy or overlap for organizations, and therefore increases the work 
factor of adversaries to adversely impact organizational operations, assets, and individuals. This 
control does not assume a single primary processing or storage location, and thus allows for 
parallel processing and storage. Related controls: CP-6, CP-7. 
Control Enhancements: 
(1) DISTRIBUTED PROCESSING AND STORAGE | POLLING TECHNIQUES  
The organization employs polling techniques to identify potential faults, errors, or compromises to 
[Assignment: organization-defined distributed processing and storage components]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Distributed processing and/or storage may be employed to reduce 
opportunities for adversaries to successfully compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or 
availability of information and information systems. However, distribution of processing 
and/or storage components does not prevent adversaries from compromising one (or more) of 
the distributed components. Polling compares the processing results and/or storage content 
from the various distributed components and subsequently voting on the outcomes. Polling 
identifies potential faults, errors, or compromises in distributed processing and/or storage 
components. Related control: SI-4.

SC-37 OUT-OF-BAND CHANNELS 
Control:  The organization employs [Assignment: organization-defined out-of-band channels] for 
the physical delivery or electronic transmission of [Assignment: organization-defined information, 
information system components, or devices] to [Assignment: organization-defined individuals or 
information systems]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Out-of-band channels include, for example, local (nonnetwork) accesses to 
information systems, network paths physically separate from network paths used for operational 
traffic, or nonelectronic paths such as the US Postal Service. This is in contrast with using the 
same channels (i.e., in-band channels) that carry routine operational traffic. Out-of-band channels 
do not have the same vulnerability/exposure as in-band channels, and hence the confidentiality, 
integrity, or availability compromises of in-band channels will not compromise the out-of-band 
channels. Organizations may employ out-of-band channels in the delivery or transmission of many 
organizational items including, for example, identifiers/authenticators, configuration management 
changes for hardware, firmware, or software, cryptographic key management information, security 
updates, system/data backups, maintenance information, and malicious code protection updates.

SC-38 OPERATIONS SECURITY 
Control:  The organization employs [Assignment: organization-defined operations security 
safeguards] to protect key organizational information throughout the system development life 
cycle. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Operations security (OPSEC) is a systematic process by which potential 
adversaries can be denied information about the capabilities and intentions of organizations by 
identifying, controlling, and protecting generally unclassified information that specifically relates 
to the planning and execution of sensitive organizational activities. The OPSEC process involves 
five steps: (i) identification of critical information (e.g., the security categorization process); (ii) 
analysis of threats; (iii) analysis of vulnerabilities; (iv) assessment of risks; and (v) the application 
of appropriate countermeasures. OPSEC safeguards are applied to both organizational information 
systems and the environments in which those systems operate. OPSEC safeguards help to protect 
the confidentiality of key information including, for example, limiting the sharing of information 
with suppliers and potential suppliers of information system components, information technology 
products and services, and with other non-organizational elements and individuals. Information 
critical to mission/business success includes, for example, user identities, element uses, suppliers, 
supply chain processes, functional and security requirements, system design specifications, testing 
protocols, and security control implementation details. Related controls: RA-2, RA-5, SA-12.

SC-39 PROCESS ISOLATION  
Control:  The information system maintains a separate execution domain for each executing 
process. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Information systems can maintain separate execution domains for each 
executing process by assigning each process a separate address space. Each information system 
process has a distinct address space so that communication between processes is performed in a 
manner controlled through the security functions, and one process cannot modify the executing 
code of another process. Maintaining separate execution domains for executing processes can be 
achieved, for example, by implementing separate address spaces. This capability is available in 
most commercial operating systems that employ multi-state processor technologies. Related

SC-40 WIRELESS LINK PROTECTION  
Control:  The information system protects external and internal [Assignment: organization-defined 
wireless links] from [Assignment: organization-defined types of signal parameter attacks or 
references to sources for such attacks]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  This control applies to internal and external wireless communication links 
that may be visible to individuals who are not authorized information system users. Adversaries 
can exploit the signal parameters of wireless links if such links are not adequately protected. There 
are many ways to exploit the signal parameters of wireless links to gain intelligence, deny service, 
or to spoof users of organizational information systems. This control reduces the impact of attacks 
that are unique to wireless systems. If organizations rely on commercial service providers for 
transmission services as commodity items rather than as fully dedicated services, it may not be 
possible to implement this control. Related controls: AC-18, SC-5. 
Control Enhancements: 
(1) WIRELESS LINK PROTECTION | ELECTROMAGNETIC INTERFERENCE  
The information system implements cryptographic mechanisms that achieve [Assignment: 
organization-defined level of protection] against the effects of intentional electromagnetic 
interference. 
Supplemental Guidance:  This control enhancement protects against intentional jamming that 
might deny or impair communications by ensuring that wireless spread spectrum waveforms 
used to provide anti-jam protection are not predictable by unauthorized individuals. The 
control enhancement may also coincidentally help to mitigate the effects of unintentional 
jamming due to interference from legitimate transmitters sharing the same spectrum. Mission 
requirements, projected threats, concept of operations, and applicable legislation, directives, 
regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines determine levels of wireless link availability 
and performance/cryptography needed. Related controls: SC-12, SC-13. 
(2) WIRELESS LINK PROTECTION | REDUCE DETECTION POTENTIAL  
The information system implements cryptographic mechanisms to reduce the detection potential 
of wireless links to [Assignment: organization-defined level of reduction].   
Supplemental Guidance:  This control enhancement is needed for covert communications and 
protecting wireless transmitters from being geo-located by their transmissions. The control 
enhancement ensures that spread spectrum waveforms used to achieve low probability of 
detection are not predictable by unauthorized individuals. Mission requirements, projected 
threats, concept of operations, and applicable legislation, directives, regulations, policies, 
standards, and guidelines determine the levels to which wireless links should be undetectable. 
Related controls: SC-12, SC-13. 
(3) WIRELESS LINK PROTECTION | IMITATIVE OR MANIPULATIVE COMMUNICATIONS DECEPTION  
The information system implements cryptographic mechanisms to identify and reject wireless 
transmissions that are deliberate attempts to achieve imitative or manipulative communications 
deception based on signal parameters.

APPENDIX F-SC   PAGE F-212 
Supplemental Guidance:  This control enhancement ensures that the signal parameters of 
wireless transmissions are not predictable by unauthorized individuals. Such unpredictability 
reduces the probability of imitative or manipulative communications deception based upon 
signal parameters alone. Related controls: SC-12, SC-13. 
(4) WIRELESS LINK PROTECTION | SIGNAL PARAMETER IDENTIFICATION  
The information system implements cryptographic mechanisms to prevent the identification of 
[Assignment: organization-defined wireless transmitters] by using the transmitter signal 
parameters.  
Supplemental Guidance:  Radio fingerprinting techniques identify the unique signal parameters 
of transmitters to fingerprint such transmitters for purposes of tracking and mission/user 
identification. This control enhancement protects against the unique identification of wireless 
transmitters for purposes of intelligence exploitation by ensuring that anti-fingerprinting 
alterations to signal parameters are not predictable by unauthorized individuals. This control 
enhancement helps assure mission success when anonymity is required. Related controls: SC-

exceptions: [Assignment: organization-defined exceptions where remote activation of sensors 
is allowed]; and 
b. Provides an explicit indication of sensor use to [Assignment: organization-defined class of 
users]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  This control often applies to types of information systems or system 
components characterized as mobile devices, for example, smart phones, tablets, and E-readers. 
These systems often include sensors that can collect and record data regarding the environment 
where the system is in use. Sensors that are embedded within mobile devices include, for example,

cameras, microphones, Global Positioning System (GPS) mechanisms, and accelerometers. While 
the sensors on mobiles devices provide an important function, if activated covertly, such devices 
can potentially provide a means for adversaries to learn valuable information about individuals 
and organizations. For example, remotely activating the GPS function on a mobile device could 
provide an adversary with the ability to track the specific movements of an individual. 
Control Enhancements: 
(1) SENSOR CAPABILITY AND DATA | REPORTING TO AUTHORIZED INDIVIDUALS OR ROLES 
The organization ensures that the information system is configured so that data or information 
collected by the [Assignment: organization-defined sensors] is only reported to authorized 
individuals or roles. 
Supplemental Guidance:  In situations where sensors are activated by authorized individuals 
(e.g., end users), it is still possible that the data/information collected by the sensors will be 
sent to unauthorized entities. 
(2) SENSOR CAPABILITY AND DATA | AUTHORIZED USE  
The organization employs the following measures: [Assignment: organization-defined measures], 
so that data or information collected by [Assignment: organization-defined sensors] is only used 
for authorized purposes. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Information collected by sensors for a specific authorized purpose 
potentially could be misused for some unauthorized purpose. For example, GPS sensors that 
are used to support traffic navigation could be misused to track movements of individuals.  
Measures to mitigate such activities include, for example, additional training to ensure that 
authorized parties do not abuse their authority, or (in the case where sensor data/information 
is maintained by external parties) contractual restrictions on the use of the data/information. 
(3) SENSOR CAPABILITY AND DATA | PROHIBIT USE OF DEVICES  
The organization prohibits the use of devices possessing [Assignment: organization-defined 
environmental sensing capabilities] in [Assignment: organization-defined facilities, areas, or 
systems]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  For example, organizations may prohibit individuals from bringing cell 
phones or digital cameras into certain facilities or specific controlled areas within facilities 
where classified information is stored or sensitive conversations are taking place.

Supplemental Guidance:  Detonation chambers, also known as dynamic execution environments, 
allow organizations to open email attachments, execute untrusted or suspicious applications, and 
execute Universal Resource Locator (URL) requests in the safety of an isolated environment or 
virtualized sandbox. These protected and isolated execution environments provide a means of 
determining whether the associated attachments/applications contain malicious code. While 
related to the concept of deception nets, the control is not intended to maintain a long-term 
environment in which adversaries can operate and their actions can be observed. Rather, it is 
intended to quickly identify malicious code and reduce the likelihood that the code is propagated 
to user environments of operation (or prevent such propagation completely). Related controls: SC-

Supplemental Guidance:  This control addresses the establishment of policy and procedures for the 
effective implementation of selected security controls and control enhancements in the SI family. 
Policy and procedures reflect applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, 
policies, standards, and guidance. Security program policies and procedures at the organization 
level may make the need for system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The policy can 
be included as part of the general information security policy for organizations or conversely, can 
be represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex nature of certain organizations. The 
procedures can be established for the security program in general and for particular information 
systems, if needed. The organizational risk management strategy is a key factor in establishing 
policy and procedures. Related control: PM-9.

b. Tests software and firmware updates related to flaw remediation for effectiveness and 
potential side effects before installation; 
c. Installs security-relevant software and firmware updates within [Assignment: organization-
defined time period] of the release of the updates; and 
d. Incorporates flaw remediation into the organizational configuration management process. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Organizations identify information systems affected by announced 
software flaws including potential vulnerabilities resulting from those flaws, and report this 
information to designated organizational personnel with information security responsibilities. 
Security-relevant software updates include, for example, patches, service packs, hot fixes, and 
anti-virus signatures. Organizations also address flaws discovered during security assessments,

continuous monitoring, incident response activities, and system error handling. Organizations take 
advantage of available resources such as the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) or Common 
Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) databases in remediating flaws discovered in organizational 
information systems. By incorporating flaw remediation into ongoing configuration management 
processes, required/anticipated remediation actions can be tracked and verified. Flaw remediation 
actions that can be tracked and verified include, for example, determining whether organizations 
follow US-CERT guidance and Information Assurance Vulnerability Alerts. Organization-defined 
time periods for updating security-relevant software and firmware may vary based on a variety of 
factors including, for example, the security category of the information system or the criticality of 
the update (i.e., severity of the vulnerability related to the discovered flaw). Some types of flaw 
remediation may require more testing than other types. Organizations determine the degree and 
type of testing needed for the specific type of flaw remediation activity under consideration and 
also the types of changes that are to be configuration-managed. In some situations, organizations 
may determine that the testing of software and/or firmware updates is not necessary or practical, 
for example, when implementing simple anti-virus signature updates. Organizations may also 
consider in testing decisions, whether security-relevant software or firmware updates are obtained 
from authorized sources with appropriate digital signatures. Related controls: CA-2, CA-7, CM-3,

managed flaw remediation security controls. 
(2) FLAW REMEDIATION | AUTOMATED FLAW REMEDIATION STATUS  
The organization employs automated mechanisms [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] 
to determine the state of information system components with regard to flaw remediation. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Related controls: CM-6, SI-4. 
(3) FLAW REMEDIATION | TIME TO REMEDIATE FLAWS / BENCHMARKS FOR CORRECTIVE ACTIONS  
The organization: 
(a) Measures the time between flaw identification and flaw remediation; and 
(b) Establishes [Assignment: organization-defined benchmarks] for taking corrective actions. 
Supplemental Guidance:  This control enhancement requires organizations to determine the 
current time it takes on the average to correct information system flaws after such flaws have 
been identified, and subsequently establish organizational benchmarks (i.e., time frames) for 
taking corrective actions. Benchmarks can be established by type of flaw and/or severity of 
the potential vulnerability if the flaw can be exploited. 
(4) FLAW REMEDIATION | AUTOMATED PATCH MANAGEMENT TOOLS

firmware updates] automatically to [Assignment: organization-defined information system 
components]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Due to information system integrity and availability concerns, 
organizations give careful consideration to the methodology used to carry out automatic 
updates. Organizations must balance the need to ensure that the updates are installed as soon 
as possible with the need to maintain configuration management and with any mission or 
operational impacts that automatic updates might impose.

SI-3 MALICIOUS CODE PROTECTION 
 Control:  The organization: 
a. Employs malicious code protection mechanisms at information system entry and exit points to 
detect and eradicate malicious code; 
b. Updates malicious code protection mechanisms whenever new releases are available in 
accordance with organizational configuration management policy and procedures; 
c. Configures malicious code protection mechanisms to: 
1. Perform periodic scans of the information system [Assignment: organization-defined 
frequency] and real-time scans of files from external sources at [Selection (one or more); 
endpoint; network entry/exit points] as the files are downloaded, opened, or executed in 
accordance with organizational security policy; and 
2. [Selection (one or more): block malicious code; quarantine malicious code;  send alert to 
administrator; [Assignment: organization-defined action]] in response to malicious code 
detection; and 
d. Addresses the receipt of false positives during malicious code detection and eradication and 
the resulting potential impact on the availability of the information system. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Information system entry and exit points include, for example, firewalls, 
electronic mail servers, web servers, proxy servers, remote-access servers, workstations, notebook 
computers, and mobile devices. Malicious code includes, for example, viruses, worms, Trojan 
horses, and spyware. Malicious code can also be encoded in various formats (e.g., UUENCODE, 
Unicode), contained within compressed or hidden files, or hidden in files using steganography. 
Malicious code can be transported by different means including, for example, web accesses, 
electronic mail, electronic mail attachments, and portable storage devices. Malicious code 
insertions occur through the exploitation of information system vulnerabilities. Malicious code 
protection mechanisms include, for example, anti-virus signature definitions and reputation-based 
technologies. A variety of technologies and methods exist to limit or eliminate the effects of 
malicious code. Pervasive configuration management and comprehensive software integrity 
controls may be effective in preventing execution of unauthorized code. In addition to commercial 
off-the-shelf software, malicious code may also be present in custom-built software. This could 
include, for example, logic bombs, back doors, and other types of cyber attacks that could affect 
organizational missions/business functions. Traditional malicious code protection mechanisms 
cannot always detect such code. In these situations, organizations rely instead on other safeguards 
including, for example, secure coding practices, configuration management and control, trusted 
procurement processes, and monitoring practices to help ensure that software does not perform 
functions other than the functions intended. Organizations may determine that in response to the 
detection of malicious code, different actions may be warranted. For example, organizations can 
define actions in response to malicious code detection during periodic scans, actions in response to 
detection of malicious downloads, and/or actions in response to detection of maliciousness when 
attempting to open or execute files. Related controls: CM-3, MP-2, SA-4, SA-8, SA-12, SA-13,

by introducing a known benign, non-spreading test case into the information system; and 
(b) Verifies that both detection of the test case and associated incident reporting occur. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Related controls: CA-2, CA-7, RA-5. 
(7) MALICIOUS CODE PROTECTION | NONSIGNATURE-BASED DETECTION  
The information system implements nonsignature-based malicious code detection mechanisms. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Nonsignature-based detection mechanisms include, for example, the 
use of heuristics to detect, analyze, and describe the characteristics or behavior of malicious 
code and to provide safeguards against malicious code for which signatures do not yet exist or 
for which existing signatures may not be effective. This includes polymorphic malicious code 
(i.e., code that changes signatures when it replicates). This control enhancement does not 
preclude the use of signature-based detection mechanisms. 
(8) MALICIOUS CODE PROTECTION | DETECT UNAUTHORIZED COMMANDS  
The information system detects [Assignment: organization-defined unauthorized operating system 
commands] through the kernel application programming interface at [Assignment: organization-
defined information system hardware components] and [Selection (one or more): issues a warning; 
audits the command execution; prevents the execution of the command]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  This control enhancement can also be applied to critical interfaces 
other than kernel-based interfaces, including for example, interfaces with virtual machines 
and privileged applications. Unauthorized operating system commands include, for example, 
commands for kernel functions from information system processes that are not trusted to 
initiate such commands, or commands for kernel functions that are suspicious even though 
commands of that type are reasonable for processes to initiate. Organizations can define the 
malicious commands to be detected by a combination of command types, command classes, 
or specific instances of commands. Organizations can define hardware components by 
specific component, component type, location in the network, or combination therein.

(9) MALICIOUS CODE PROTECTION | AUTHENTICATE REMOTE COMMANDS 
The information system implements [Assignment: organization-defined security safeguards] to 
authenticate [Assignment: organization-defined remote commands]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  This control enhancement protects against unauthorized commands 
and replay of authorized commands. This capability is important for those remote information 
systems whose loss, malfunction, misdirection, or exploitation would have immediate and/or 
serious consequences (e.g., injury or death, property damage, loss of high-valued assets or 
sensitive information, or failure of important missions/business functions). Authentication 
safeguards for remote commands help to ensure that information systems accept and execute 
in the order intended, only authorized commands, and that unauthorized commands are 
rejected. Cryptographic mechanisms can be employed, for example, to authenticate remote 
commands. Related controls:  SC-12, SC-13, SC-23. 
(10) MALICIOUS CODE PROTECTION | MALICIOUS CODE ANALYSIS 
The organization: 
(a) Employs [Assignment: organization-defined tools and techniques] to analyze the 
characteristics and behavior of malicious code; and 
(b) Incorporates the results from malicious code analysis into organizational incident response 
and flaw remediation processes. 
Supplemental Guidance:  The application of selected malicious code analysis tools and 
techniques provides organizations with a more in-depth understanding of adversary tradecraft 
(i.e., tactics, techniques, and procedures) and the functionality and purpose of specific 
instances of malicious code. Understanding the characteristics of malicious code facilitates 
more effective organizational responses to current and future threats. Organizations can 
conduct malicious code analyses by using reverse engineering techniques or by monitoring 
the behavior of executing code.

the Nation based on law enforcement information, intelligence information, or other credible 
sources of information; 
f. Obtains legal opinion with regard to information system monitoring activities in accordance 
with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, or regulations; and 
g. Provides [Assignment: organization-defined information system monitoring information] to 
[Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles] [Selection (one or more): as needed; 
[Assignment: organization-defined frequency]]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Information system monitoring includes external and internal monitoring. 
External monitoring includes the observation of events occurring at the information system 
boundary (i.e., part of perimeter defense and boundary protection). Internal monitoring includes 
the observation of events occurring within the information system. Organizations can monitor 
information systems, for example, by observing audit activities in real time or by observing other 
system aspects such as access patterns, characteristics of access, and other actions. The monitoring 
objectives may guide determination of the events. Information system monitoring capability is 
achieved through a variety of tools and techniques (e.g., intrusion detection systems, intrusion 
prevention systems, malicious code protection software, scanning tools, audit record monitoring 
software, network monitoring software). Strategic locations for monitoring devices include, for 
example, selected perimeter locations and near server farms supporting critical applications, with 
such devices typically being employed at the managed interfaces associated with controls SC-7 
and AC-17. Einstein network monitoring devices from the Department of Homeland Security can 
also be included as monitoring devices. The granularity of monitoring information collected is 
based on organizational monitoring objectives and the capability of information systems to 
support such objectives. Specific types of transactions of interest include, for example, Hyper Text 
Transfer Protocol (HTTP) traffic that bypasses HTTP proxies. Information system monitoring is 
an integral part of organizational continuous monitoring and incident response programs. Output 
from system monitoring serves as input to continuous monitoring and incident response programs. 
A network connection is any connection with a device that communicates through a network (e.g., 
local area network, Internet). A remote connection is any connection with a device communicating 
through an external network (e.g., the Internet). Local, network, and remote connections can be 
either wired or wireless. Related controls: AC-3, AC-4, AC-8, AC-17, AU-2, AU-6, AU-7, AU-9,

Control Enhancements: 
(1) INFORMATION SYSTEM MONITORING | SYSTEM-WIDE INTRUSION DETECTION SYSTEM 
The organization connects and configures individual intrusion detection tools into an information 
system-wide intrusion detection system. 
(2) INFORMATION SYSTEM MONITORING | AUTOMATED TOOLS FOR REAL-TIME ANALYSIS 
The organization employs automated tools to support near real-time analysis of events. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Automated tools include, for example, host-based, network-based, 
transport-based, or storage-based event monitoring tools or Security Information and Event 
Management (SIEM) technologies that provide real time analysis of alerts and/or notifications 
generated by organizational information systems. 
(3) INFORMATION SYSTEM MONITORING | AUTOMATED TOOL INTEGRATION 
The organization employs automated tools to integrate intrusion detection tools into access 
control and flow control mechanisms for rapid response to attacks by enabling reconfiguration of 
these mechanisms in support of attack isolation and elimination. 
(4) INFORMATION SYSTEM MONITORING | INBOUND AND OUTBOUND COMMUNICATIONS TRAFFIC 
The information system monitors inbound and outbound communications traffic [Assignment: 
organization-defined frequency] for unusual or unauthorized activities or conditions.

signaling to external information systems. Evidence of malicious code is used to identify 
potentially compromised information systems or information system components. 
(5) INFORMATION SYSTEM MONITORING | SYSTEM-GENERATED ALERTS 
The information system alerts [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles] when the 
following indications of compromise or potential compromise occur: [Assignment: organization-
defined compromise indicators]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Alerts may be generated from a variety of sources, including, for 
example, audit records or inputs from malicious code protection mechanisms, intrusion 
detection or prevention mechanisms, or boundary protection devices such as firewalls, 
gateways, and routers. Alerts can be transmitted, for example, telephonically, by electronic 
mail messages, or by text messaging. Organizational personnel on the notification list can 
include, for example, system administrators, mission/business owners, system owners, or 
information system security officers. Related controls: AU-5, PE-6. 
(6) INFORMATION SYSTEM MONITORING | RESTRICT NON-PRIVILEGED USERS 
[Withdrawn: Incorporated into AC-6 (10)]. 
(7) INFORMATION SYSTEM MONITORING | AUTOMATED RESPONSE TO SUSPICIOUS EVENTS 
The information system notifies [Assignment: organization-defined incident response personnel 
(identified by name and/or by role)] of detected suspicious events and takes [Assignment: 
organization-defined least-disruptive actions to terminate suspicious events]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Least-disruptive actions may include, for example, initiating requests 
for human responses. 
(8) INFORMATION SYSTEM MONITORING | PROTECTION OF MONITORING INFORMATION 
[Withdrawn: Incorporated into SI-4]. 
(9) INFORMATION SYSTEM MONITORING | TESTING OF MONITORING TOOLS 
The organization tests intrusion-monitoring tools [Assignment: organization-defined frequency]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Testing intrusion-monitoring tools is necessary to ensure that the tools 
are operating correctly and continue to meet the monitoring objectives of organizations. The 
frequency of testing depends on the types of tools used by organizations and methods of 
deployment. Related control: CP-9. 
(10) INFORMATION SYSTEM MONITORING | VISIBILITY OF ENCRYPTED COMMUNICATIONS 
The organization makes provisions so that [Assignment: organization-defined encrypted 
communications traffic] is visible to [Assignment: organization-defined information system 
monitoring tools]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Organizations balance the potentially conflicting needs for encrypting 
communications traffic and for having insight into such traffic from a monitoring perspective. 
For some organizations, the need to ensure the confidentiality of communications traffic is 
paramount; for others, mission-assurance is of greater concern. Organizations determine 
whether the visibility requirement applies to internal encrypted traffic, encrypted traffic 
intended for external destinations, or a subset of the traffic types. 
(11) INFORMATION SYSTEM MONITORING | ANALYZE COMMUNICATIONS TRAFFIC ANOMALIES 
The organization analyzes outbound communications traffic at the external boundary of the 
information system and selected [Assignment: organization-defined interior points within the 
system (e.g., subnetworks, subsystems)] to discover anomalies. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Anomalies within organizational information systems include, for 
example, large file transfers, long-time persistent connections, unusual protocols and ports in 
use, and attempted communications with suspected malicious external addresses. 
(12) INFORMATION SYSTEM MONITORING | AUTOMATED ALERTS 
The organization employs automated mechanisms to alert security personnel of the following 
inappropriate or unusual activities with security implications: [Assignment: organization-defined 
activities that trigger alerts]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  This control enhancement focuses on the security alerts generated by 
organizations and transmitted using automated means. In contrast to the alerts generated by 
information systems in SI-4 (5), which tend to focus on information sources internal to the

systems (e.g., audit records), the sources of information for this enhancement can include 
other entities as well (e.g., suspicious activity reports, reports on potential insider threats). 
Related controls: AC-18, IA-3. 
(13) INFORMATION SYSTEM MONITORING | ANALYZE TRAFFIC / EVENT PATTERNS 
The organization: 
(a) Analyzes communications traffic/event patterns for the information system; 
(b) Develops profiles representing common traffic patterns and/or events; and 
(c) Uses the traffic/event profiles in tuning system-monitoring devices to reduce the number of 
false positives and the number of false negatives. 
(14) INFORMATION SYSTEM MONITORING | WIRELESS INTRUSION DETECTION 
The organization employs a wireless intrusion detection system to identify rogue wireless devices 
and to detect attack attempts and potential compromises/breaches to the information system. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Wireless signals may radiate beyond the confines of organization-
controlled facilities. Organizations proactively search for unauthorized wireless connections 
including the conduct of thorough scans for unauthorized wireless access points. Scans are not 
limited to those areas within facilities containing information systems, but also include areas 
outside of facilities as needed, to verify that unauthorized wireless access points are not 
connected to the systems. Related controls: AC-18, IA-3. 
(15) INFORMATION SYSTEM MONITORING | WIRELESS TO WIRELINE COMMUNICATIONS 
The organization employs an intrusion detection system to monitor wireless communications 
traffic as the traffic passes from wireless to wireline networks. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Related control: AC-18. 
(16) INFORMATION SYSTEM MONITORING | CORRELATE MONITORING INFORMATION 
The organization correlates information from monitoring tools employed throughout the 
information system. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Correlating information from different monitoring tools can provide a 
more comprehensive view of information system activity. The correlation of monitoring tools 
that usually work in isolation (e.g., host monitoring, network monitoring, anti-virus software) 
can provide an organization-wide view and in so doing, may reveal otherwise unseen attack 
patterns. Understanding the capabilities/limitations of diverse monitoring tools and how to 
maximize the utility of information generated by those tools can help organizations to build, 
operate, and maintain effective monitoring programs. Related control: AU-6. 
(17) INFORMATION SYSTEM MONITORING | INTEGRATED SITUATIONAL AWARENESS 
The organization correlates information from monitoring physical, cyber, and supply chain 
activities to achieve integrated, organization-wide situational awareness. 
Supplemental Guidance:  This control enhancement correlates monitoring information from a 
more diverse set of information sources to achieve integrated situational awareness. Integrated 
situational awareness from a combination of physical, cyber, and supply chain monitoring 
activities enhances the capability of organizations to more quickly detect sophisticated cyber 
attacks and investigate the methods and techniques employed to carry out such attacks. In 
contrast to SI-4 (16) which correlates the various cyber monitoring information, this control 
enhancement correlates monitoring beyond just the cyber domain. Such monitoring may help 
reveal attacks on organizations that are operating across multiple attack vectors. Related 
control: SA-12. 
(18) INFORMATION SYSTEM MONITORING | ANALYZE TRAFFIC / COVERT EXFILTRATION 
The organization analyzes outbound communications traffic at the external boundary of the 
information system (i.e., system perimeter) and at [Assignment: organization-defined interior 
points within the system (e.g., subsystems, subnetworks)] to detect covert exfiltration of 
information. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Covert means that can be used for the unauthorized exfiltration of 
organizational information include, for example, steganography.

(19) INFORMATION SYSTEM MONITORING | INDIVIDUALS POSING GREATER RISK 
The organization implements [Assignment: organization-defined additional monitoring] of 
individuals who have been identified by [Assignment: organization-defined sources] as posing an 
increased level of risk. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Indications of increased risk from individuals can be obtained from a 
variety of sources including, for example, human resource records, intelligence agencies, law 
enforcement organizations, and/or other credible sources. The monitoring of individuals is 
closely coordinated with management, legal, security, and human resources officials within 
organizations conducting such monitoring and complies with federal legislation, Executive 
Orders, policies, directives, regulations, and standards.  
(20) INFORMATION SYSTEM MONITORING | PRIVILEGED USER 
The organization implements [Assignment: organization-defined additional monitoring] of 
privileged users. 
(21) INFORMATION SYSTEM MONITORING | PROBATIONARY PERIODS 
The organization implements [Assignment: organization-defined additional monitoring] of 
individuals during [Assignment: organization-defined probationary period]. 
(22) INFORMATION SYSTEM MONITORING | UNAUTHORIZED NETWORK SERVICES 
The information system detects network services that have not been authorized or approved by 
[Assignment: organization-defined authorization or approval processes] and [Selection (one or 
more): audits; alerts [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles]]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Unauthorized or unapproved network services include, for example, 
services in service-oriented architectures that lack organizational verification or validation 
and therefore may be unreliable or serve as malicious rogues for valid services. Related 
controls: AC-6, CM-7, SA-5, SA-9. 
(23) INFORMATION SYSTEM MONITORING | HOST-BASED DEVICES 
The organization implements [Assignment: organization-defined host-based monitoring 
mechanisms] at [Assignment: organization-defined information system components]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Information system components where host-based monitoring can be 
implemented include, for example, servers, workstations, and mobile devices. Organizations 
consider employing host-based monitoring mechanisms from multiple information technology 
product developers. 
(24) INFORMATION SYSTEM MONITORING | INDICATORS OF COMPROMISE 
The information system discovers, collects, distributes, and uses indicators of compromise. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Indicators of compromise (IOC) are forensic artifacts from intrusions 
that are identified on organizational information systems (at the host or network level). IOCs 
provide organizations with valuable information on objects or information systems that have 
been compromised. IOCs for the discovery of compromised hosts can include for example, 
the creation of registry key values. IOCs for network traffic include, for example, Universal 
Resource Locator (URL) or protocol elements that indicate malware command and control 
servers. The rapid distribution and adoption of IOCs can improve information security by 
reducing the time that information systems and organizations are vulnerable to the same 
exploit or attack.

Supplemental Guidance:  The United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT) 
generates security alerts and advisories to maintain situational awareness across the federal 
government. Security directives are issued by OMB or other designated organizations with the 
responsibility and authority to issue such directives. Compliance to security directives is essential 
due to the critical nature of many of these directives and the potential immediate adverse effects 
on organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation should the 
directives not be implemented in a timely manner. External organizations include, for example, 
external mission/business partners, supply chain partners, external service providers, and other 
peer/supporting organizations.  Related control: SI-2. 
Control Enhancements: 
(1) SECURITY ALERTS, ADVISORIES, AND DIRECTIVES | AUTOMATED ALERTS AND ADVISORIES 
The organization employs automated mechanisms to make security alert and advisory information 
available throughout the organization. 
Supplemental Guidance:  The significant number of changes to organizational information 
systems and the environments in which those systems operate requires the dissemination of 
security-related information to a variety of organizational entities that have a direct interest in 
the success of organizational missions and business functions. Based on the information 
provided by the security alerts and advisories, changes may be required at one or more of the 
three tiers related to the management of information security risk including the governance 
level, mission/business process/enterprise architecture level, and the information system level.

(5) SOFTWARE, FIRMWARE, AND INFORMATION INTEGRITY | AUTOMATED RESPONSE TO INTEGRITY VIOLATIONS  
The information system automatically [Selection (one or more): shuts the information system 
down; restarts the information system; implements [Assignment: organization-defined security 
safeguards]] when integrity violations are discovered. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Organizations may define different integrity checking and anomaly 
responses: (i) by type of information (e.g., firmware, software, user data); (ii) by specific 
information (e.g., boot firmware, boot firmware for a specific types of machines); or (iii) a 
combination of both. Automatic implementation of specific safeguards within organizational 
information systems includes, for example, reversing the changes, halting the information 
system, or triggering audit alerts when unauthorized modifications to critical security files 
occur. 
(6) SOFTWARE, FIRMWARE, AND INFORMATION INTEGRITY | CRYPTOGRAPHIC PROTECTION  
The information system implements cryptographic mechanisms to detect unauthorized changes to 
software, firmware, and information. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Cryptographic mechanisms used for the protection of integrity include, 
for example, digital signatures and the computation and application of signed hashes using 
asymmetric cryptography, protecting the confidentiality of the key used to generate the hash, 
and using the public key to verify the hash information. Related control: SC-13. 
(7) SOFTWARE, FIRMWARE, AND INFORMATION INTEGRITY | INTEGRATION OF DETECTION AND RESPONSE  
The organization incorporates the detection of unauthorized [Assignment: organization-defined 
security-relevant changes to the information system] into the organizational incident response 
capability. 
Supplemental Guidance:  This control enhancement helps to ensure that detected events are 
tracked, monitored, corrected, and available for historical purposes. Maintaining historical 
records is important both for being able to identify and discern adversary actions over an 
extended period of time and for possible legal actions. Security-relevant changes include, for 
example, unauthorized changes to established configuration settings or unauthorized elevation 
of information system privileges. Related controls: IR-4, IR-5, SI-4. 
(8) SOFTWARE, FIRMWARE, AND INFORMATION INTEGRITY | AUDITING CAPABILITY FOR SIGNIFICANT EVENTS  
The information system, upon detection of a potential integrity violation, provides the capability to 
audit the event and initiates the following actions: [Selection (one or more): generates an audit 
record; alerts current user; alerts [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles]; 
[Assignment: organization-defined other actions]].

APPENDIX F-SI   PAGE F-227 
Supplemental Guidance:  Unauthorized modifications to boot firmware may be indicative of a 
sophisticated, targeted cyber attack. These types of cyber attacks can result in a permanent 
denial of service (e.g., if the firmware is corrupted) or a persistent malicious code presence 
(e.g., if code is embedded within the firmware). Devices can protect the integrity of the boot 
firmware in organizational information systems by: (i) verifying the integrity and authenticity 
of all updates to the boot firmware prior to applying changes to the boot devices; and (ii) 
preventing unauthorized processes from modifying the boot firmware. 
(11) SOFTWARE, FIRMWARE, AND INFORMATION INTEGRITY | CONFINED ENVIRONMENTS WITH LIMITED PRIVILEGES  
The organization requires that [Assignment: organization-defined user-installed software] execute 
in a confined physical or virtual machine environment with limited privileges.   
Supplemental Guidance:  Organizations identify software that may be of greater concern with 
regard to origin or potential for containing malicious code. For this type of software, user 
installations occur in confined environments of operation to limit or contain damage from 
malicious code that may be executed. 
(12) SOFTWARE, FIRMWARE, AND INFORMATION INTEGRITY | INTEGRITY VERIFICATION  
The organization requires that the integrity of [Assignment: organization-defined user-installed 
software] be verified prior to execution. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Organizations verify the integrity of user-installed software prior to 
execution to reduce the likelihood of executing malicious code or code that contains errors 
from unauthorized modifications. Organizations consider the practicality of approaches to 
verifying software integrity including, for example, availability of checksums of adequate 
trustworthiness from software developers or vendors. 
(13) SOFTWARE, FIRMWARE, AND INFORMATION INTEGRITY | CODE EXECUTION IN PROTECTED ENVIRONMENTS  
The organization allows execution of binary or machine-executable code obtained from sources 
with limited or no warranty and without the provision of source code only in confined physical or 
virtual machine environments and with the explicit approval of [Assignment: organization-defined 
personnel or roles]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  This control enhancement applies to all sources of binary or machine-
executable code including, for example, commercial software/firmware and open source 
software. 
(14) SOFTWARE, FIRMWARE, AND INFORMATION INTEGRITY | BINARY OR MACHINE EXECUTABLE CODE 
The organization: 
(a) Prohibits the use of binary or machine-executable code from sources with limited or no 
warranty and without the provision of source code; and 
(b) Provides exceptions to the source code requirement only for compelling mission/operational 
requirements and with the approval of the authorizing official. 
Supplemental Guidance:  This control enhancement applies to all sources of binary or machine-
executable code including, for example, commercial software/firmware and open source 
software. Organizations assess software products without accompanying source code from 
sources with limited or no warranty for potential security impacts. The assessments address 
the fact that these types of software products may be very difficult to review, repair, or 
extend, given that organizations, in most cases, do not have access to the original source code, 
and there may be no owners who could make such repairs on behalf of organizations. Related 
control: SA-5. 
(15) SOFTWARE, FIRMWARE, AND INFORMATION INTEGRITY | CODE AUTHENTICATION  
The information system implements cryptographic mechanisms to authenticate [Assignment: 
organization-defined software or firmware components] prior to installation. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Cryptographic authentication includes, for example, verifying that 
software or firmware components have been digitally signed using certificates recognized and 
approved by organizations. Code signing is an effective method to protect against malicious 
code.

SI-8 SPAM PROTECTION   
 Control:  The organization: 
a. Employs spam protection mechanisms at information system entry and exit points to detect 
and take action on unsolicited messages; and 
b. Updates spam protection mechanisms when new releases are available in accordance with 
organizational configuration management policy and procedures. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Information system entry and exit points include, for example, firewalls, 
electronic mail servers, web servers, proxy servers, remote-access servers, workstations, mobile 
devices, and notebook/laptop computers. Spam can be transported by different means including, 
for example, electronic mail, electronic mail attachments, and web accesses. Spam protection 
mechanisms include, for example, signature definitions. Related controls: AT-2, AT-3, SC-5, SC-
7, SI-3. 
Control Enhancements: 
(1) SPAM PROTECTION | CENTRAL MANAGEMENT  
The organization centrally manages spam protection mechanisms. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Central management is the organization-wide management and 
implementation of spam protection mechanisms. Central management includes planning, 
implementing, assessing, authorizing, and monitoring the organization-defined, centrally 
managed spam protection security controls. Related controls: AU-3, SI-2, SI-7. 
(2) SPAM PROTECTION | AUTOMATIC UPDATES  
The information system automatically updates spam protection mechanisms. 
(3) SPAM PROTECTION | CONTINUOUS LEARNING CAPABILITY  
The information system implements spam protection mechanisms with a learning capability to 
more effectively identify legitimate communications traffic. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Learning mechanisms include, for example, Bayesian filters that 
respond to user inputs identifying specific traffic as spam or legitimate by updating algorithm 
parameters and thereby more accurately separating types of traffic.

SI-9 INFORMATION INPUT RESTRICTIONS 
[Withdrawn: Incorporated into AC-2, AC-3, AC-5, AC-6]. 
SI-10 INFORMATION INPUT VALIDATION 
Control:  The information system checks the validity of [Assignment: organization-defined 
information inputs]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Checking the valid syntax and semantics of information system inputs 
(e.g., character set, length, numerical range, and acceptable values) verifies that inputs match 
specified definitions for format and content. Software applications typically follow well-defined 
protocols that use structured messages (i.e., commands or queries) to communicate between 
software modules or system components. Structured messages can contain raw or unstructured 
data interspersed with metadata or control information. If software applications use attacker-
supplied inputs to construct structured messages without properly encoding such messages, then 
the attacker could insert malicious commands or special characters that can cause the data to be 
interpreted as control information or metadata. Consequently, the module or component that 
receives the tainted output will perform the wrong operations or otherwise interpret the data 
incorrectly. Prescreening inputs prior to passing to interpreters prevents the content from being 
unintentionally interpreted as commands. Input validation helps to ensure accurate and correct 
inputs and prevent attacks such as cross-site scripting and a variety of injection attacks. 
Control Enhancements: 
(1) INFORMATION INPUT VALIDATION | MANUAL OVERRIDE CAPABILITY  
The information system: 
(a) Provides a manual override capability for input validation of [Assignment: organization-
defined inputs]; 
(b) Restricts the use of the manual override capability to only [Assignment: organization-defined 
authorized individuals]; and 
(c) Audits the use of the manual override capability. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Related controls:  CM-3, CM-5. 
(2) INFORMATION INPUT VALIDATION | REVIEW / RESOLUTION OF ERRORS  
The organization ensures that input validation errors are reviewed and resolved within 
[Assignment: organization-defined time period]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Resolution of input validation errors includes, for example, correcting 
systemic causes of errors and resubmitting transactions with corrected input. 
(3) INFORMATION INPUT VALIDATION | PREDICTABLE BEHAVIOR  
The information system behaves in a predictable and documented manner that reflects 
organizational and system objectives when invalid inputs are received. 
Supplemental Guidance:  A common vulnerability in organizational information systems is 
unpredictable behavior when invalid inputs are received. This control enhancement ensures 
that there is predictable behavior in the face of invalid inputs by specifying information 
system responses that facilitate transitioning the system to known states without adverse, 
unintended side effects. 
(4) INFORMATION INPUT VALIDATION | REVIEW / TIMING INTERACTIONS  
The organization accounts for timing interactions among information system components in 
determining appropriate responses for invalid inputs. 
Supplemental Guidance:  In addressing invalid information system inputs received across 
protocol interfaces, timing interfaces become relevant, where one protocol needs to consider 
the impact of the error response on other protocols within the protocol stack. For example, 
802.11 standard wireless network protocols do not interact well with Transmission Control 
Protocols (TCP) when packets are dropped (which could be due to invalid packet input). TCP 
assumes packet losses are due to congestion, while packets lost over 802.11 links are typically 
dropped due to collisions or noise on the link. If TCP makes a congestion response, it takes

precisely the wrong action in response to a collision event. Adversaries may be able to use 
apparently acceptable individual behaviors of the protocols in concert to achieve adverse 
effects through suitable construction of invalid input. 
(5) INFORMATION INPUT VALIDATION | RESTRICT INPUTS TO TRUSTED SOURCES AND APPROVED FORMATS 
The organization restricts the use of information inputs to [Assignment: organization-defined 
trusted sources] and/or [Assignment: organization-defined formats]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  This control enhancement applies the concept of whitelisting to 
information inputs. Specifying known trusted sources for information inputs and acceptable 
formats for such inputs can reduce the probability of malicious activity.

SI-11 ERROR HANDLING 
Control:  The information system: 
a. Generates error messages that provide information necessary for corrective actions without 
revealing information that could be exploited by adversaries; and 
b. Reveals error messages only to [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Organizations carefully consider the structure/content of error messages. 
The extent to which information systems are able to identify and handle error conditions is guided 
by organizational policy and operational requirements. Information that could be exploited by 
adversaries includes, for example, erroneous logon attempts with passwords entered by mistake as 
the username, mission/business information that can be derived from (if not stated explicitly by) 
information recorded, and personal information such as account numbers, social security numbers, 
and credit card numbers. In addition, error messages may provide a covert channel for transmitting 
information. Related controls: AU-2, AU-3, SC-31.

directives, policies, regulations, standards, and operational requirements. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Information handling and retention requirements cover the full life cycle of 
information, in some cases extending beyond the disposal of information systems. The National

SI-13 PREDICTABLE FAILURE PREVENTION 
Control:  The organization: 
a. Determines mean time to failure (MTTF) for [Assignment: organization-defined information 
system components] in specific environments of operation; and 
b. Provides substitute information system components and a means to exchange active and 
standby components at [Assignment: organization-defined MTTF substitution criteria]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  While MTTF is primarily a reliability issue, this control addresses potential 
failures of specific information system components that provide security capability. Failure rates 
reflect installation-specific consideration, not industry-average. Organizations define criteria for 
substitution of information system components based on MTTF value with consideration for 
resulting potential harm from component failures. Transfer of responsibilities between active and 
standby components does not compromise safety, operational readiness, or security capability 
(e.g., preservation of state variables). Standby components remain available at all times except for 
maintenance issues or recovery failures in progress. Related controls: CP-2, CP-10, MA-6. 
Control Enhancements: 
(1) PREDICTABLE FAILURE PREVENTION | TRANSFERRING COMPONENT RESPONSIBILITIES  
The organization takes information system components out of service by transferring component 
responsibilities to substitute components no later than [Assignment: organization-defined fraction 
or percentage] of mean time to failure. 
(2) PREDICTABLE FAILURE PREVENTION | TIME LIMIT ON PROCESS EXECUTION WITHOUT SUPERVISION  
[Withdrawn: Incorporated into SI-7 (16)]. 
(3) PREDICTABLE FAILURE PREVENTION | MANUAL TRANSFER BETWEEN COMPONENTS  
The organization manually initiates transfers between active and standby information system 
components [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] if the mean time to failure exceeds 
[Assignment: organization-defined time period]. 
(4) PREDICTABLE FAILURE PREVENTION | STANDBY COMPONENT INSTALLATION / NOTIFICATION  
The organization, if information system component failures are detected: 
(a) Ensures that the standby components are successfully and transparently installed within 
[Assignment: organization-defined time period]; and 
(b) [Selection (one or more): activates [Assignment: organization-defined alarm]; automatically 
shuts down the information system]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Automatic or manual transfer of components from standby to active 
mode can occur, for example, upon detection of component failures. 
(5) PREDICTABLE FAILURE PREVENTION | FAILOVER CAPABILITY  
The organization provides [Selection: real-time; near real-time] [Assignment: organization-defined 
failover capability] for the information system. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Failover refers to the automatic switchover to an alternate information 
system upon the failure of the primary information system. Failover capability includes, for 
example, incorporating mirrored information system operations at alternate processing sites or 
periodic data mirroring at regular intervals defined by recovery time periods of organizations.

SI-14 NON-PERSISTENCE 
Control:  The organization implements non-persistent [Assignment: organization-defined 
information system components and services] that are initiated in a known state and terminated 
[Selection (one or more): upon end of session of use; periodically at [Assignment: organization-
defined frequency]]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  This control mitigates risk from advanced persistent threats (APTs) by 
significantly reducing the targeting capability of adversaries (i.e., window of opportunity and 
available attack surface) to initiate and complete cyber attacks. By implementing the concept of 
non-persistence for selected information system components, organizations can provide a known 
state computing resource for a specific period of time that does not give adversaries sufficient time 
on target to exploit vulnerabilities in organizational information systems and the environments in 
which those systems operate. Since the advanced persistent threat is a high-end threat with regard 
to capability, intent, and targeting, organizations assume that over an extended period of time, a 
percentage of cyber attacks will be successful. Non-persistent information system components and 
services are activated as required using protected information and terminated periodically or upon 
the end of sessions. Non-persistence increases the work factor of adversaries in attempting to 
compromise or breach organizational information systems. 
Non-persistent system components can be implemented, for example, by periodically re-imaging 
components or by using a variety of common virtualization techniques. Non-persistent services 
can be implemented using virtualization techniques as part of virtual machines or as new instances 
of processes on physical machines (either persistent or non-persistent).The benefit of periodic 
refreshes of information system components/services is that it does not require organizations to 
first determine whether compromises of components or services have occurred (something that 
may often be difficult for organizations to determine). The refresh of selected information system 
components and services occurs with sufficient frequency to prevent the spread or intended impact 
of attacks, but not with such frequency that it makes the information system unstable. In some 
instances, refreshes of critical components and services may be done periodically in order to 
hinder the ability of adversaries to exploit optimum windows of vulnerabilities. Related controls: 
SC-30, SC-34. 
Control Enhancements: 
(1) NON-PERSISTENCE | REFRESH FROM TRUSTED SOURCES  
The organization ensures that software and data employed during information system component 
and service refreshes are obtained from [Assignment: organization-defined trusted sources]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Trusted sources include, for example, software/data from write-once, 
read-only media or from selected off-line secure storage facilities.

SI-15 INFORMATION OUTPUT FILTERING 
Control:  The information system validates information output from [Assignment: organization-
defined software programs and/or applications] to ensure that the information is consistent with 
the expected content. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Certain types of cyber attacks (e.g., SQL injections) produce output results 
that are unexpected or inconsistent with the output results that would normally be expected from 
software programs or applications. This control enhancement focuses on detecting extraneous 
content, preventing such extraneous content from being displayed, and alerting monitoring tools 
that anomalous behavior has been discovered. Related controls: SI-3, SI-4.

Supplemental Guidance:  Some adversaries launch attacks with the intent of executing code in non-
executable regions of memory or in memory locations that are prohibited. Security safeguards 
employed to protect memory include, for example, data execution prevention and address space 
layout randomization. Data execution prevention safeguards can either be hardware-enforced or

critical system components or between system components and operational facilities. Fail-safe 
procedures include, for example, alerting operator personnel and providing specific instructions on 
subsequent steps to take (e.g., do nothing, reestablish system settings, shut down processes, restart 
the system, or contact designated organizational personnel). Related controls: CP-12, CP-13, SC-

INFORMATION SECURITY PROGRAMS 
ORGANIZATION-WIDE INFORMATION SECURITY PROGRAM MANAGEMENT CONTROLS 
he Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) requires organizations to 
develop and implement an organization-wide information security program to address 
information security for the information and information systems that support the 
operations and assets of the organization, including those provided or managed by another 
organization, contractor, or other source. The information security program management (PM) 
controls described in this appendix are typically implemented at the organization level and not 
directed at individual organizational information systems. The program management controls 
have been designed to facilitate compliance with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, 
directives, policies, regulations, and standards. The controls are independent of any FIPS 
Publication 200 impact levels and therefore, are not directly associated with any of the security 
control baselines described in Appendix D. The program management controls do, however, 
complement the security controls in Appendix F and focus on the programmatic, organization-
wide information security requirements that are independent of any particular information system 
and are essential for managing information security programs. Tailoring guidance can be applied 
to the program management controls in a manner similar to how the guidance is applied to 
security controls in Appendix F. Organizations specify the individual or individuals responsible 
and accountable for the development, implementation, assessment, authorization, and monitoring 
of the program management controls. Organizations document program management controls in 
the information security program plan. The organization-wide information security program plan 
supplements the individual security plans developed for each organizational information system. 
Together, the security plans for the individual information systems and the information security 
program cover the totality of security controls employed by the organization. 
In addition to documenting the information security program management controls, the security 
program plan provides a vehicle for the organization, in a central repository, to document all 
security controls from Appendix F that have been designated as common controls (i.e., security 
controls inheritable by organizational information systems).111 The information security program 
management controls and common controls contained in the information security program plan 
are implemented, assessed for effectiveness,112 and authorized by a senior organizational official, 
with the same or similar authority and responsibility for managing risk as the authorization 
officials for information systems. Plans of action and milestones are developed and maintained 
for the program management and common controls that are deemed through assessment to be less 
than effective. Information security program management and common controls are also subject 
to the same continuous monitoring requirements as security controls employed in individual 
organizational information systems. 
                                                 
111 Common controls are those security controls that are inheritable by one or more organizational information systems, 
and thus are separate and distinct from information security program management controls. 
112 Assessment procedures for program management controls and common controls can be found in NIST Special 
Publication 800-53A.

Cautionary Note 
Organizations are required to implement security program management controls to provide a foundation 
for the organizational information security program. The successful implementation of security controls 
for organizational information systems depends on the successful implementation of organization-wide 
program management controls. However, the manner in which organizations implement the program 
management controls depends on specific organizational characteristics including, for example, the size, 
complexity, and mission/business requirements of the respective organizations.

PM-1 INFORMATION SECURITY PROGRAM PLAN 
Control:  The organization: 
a. Develops and disseminates an organization-wide information security program plan that: 
1. Provides an overview of the requirements for the security program and a description of 
the security program management controls and common controls in place or planned for 
meeting those requirements; 
2. Includes the identification and assignment of roles, responsibilities, management 
commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and compliance; 
3. Reflects coordination among organizational entities responsible for the different aspects 
of information security (i.e., technical, physical, personnel, cyber-physical); and 
4. Is approved by a senior official with responsibility and accountability for the risk being 
incurred to organizational operations (including mission, functions, image, and 
reputation), organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation; 
b. Reviews the organization-wide information security program plan [Assignment: organization-
defined frequency]; 
c. Updates the plan to address organizational changes and problems identified during plan 
implementation or security control assessments; and 
d. Protects the information security program plan from unauthorized disclosure and 
modification. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Information security program plans can be represented in single documents 
or compilations of documents at the discretion of organizations. The plans document the program 
management controls and organization-defined common controls. Information security program 
plans provide sufficient information about the program management controls/common controls 
(including specification of parameters for any assignment and selection statements either explicitly 
or by reference) to enable implementations that are unambiguously compliant with the intent of 
the plans and a determination of the risk to be incurred if the plans are implemented as intended. 
The security plans for individual information systems and the organization-wide information 
security program plan together, provide complete coverage for all security controls employed 
within the organization. Common controls are documented in an appendix to the organization’s 
information security program plan unless the controls are included in a separate security plan for 
an information system (e.g., security controls employed as part of an intrusion detection system 
providing organization-wide boundary protection inherited by one or more organizational 
information systems). The organization-wide information security program plan will indicate 
which separate security plans contain descriptions of common controls.  
Organizations have the flexibility to describe common controls in a single document or in multiple 
documents. In the case of multiple documents, the documents describing common controls are 
included as attachments to the information security program plan. If the information security 
program plan contains multiple documents, the organization specifies in each document the 
organizational official or officials responsible for the development, implementation, assessment, 
authorization, and monitoring of the respective common controls. For example, the organization 
may require that the Facilities Management Office develop, implement, assess, authorize, and 
continuously monitor common physical and environmental protection controls from the PE family 
when such controls are not associated with a particular information system but instead, support 
multiple information systems. Related control: PM-8.

Control:  The organization appoints a senior information security officer with the mission and 
resources to coordinate, develop, implement, and maintain an organization-wide information 
security program.  
Supplemental Guidance:  The security officer described in this control is an organizational official.  
For a federal agency (as defined in applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies,

a. Ensures that all capital planning and investment requests include the resources needed to 
implement the information security program and documents all exceptions to this 
requirement; 
b. Employs a business case/Exhibit 300/Exhibit 53 to record the resources required; and 
c. Ensures that information security resources are available for expenditure as planned. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Organizations consider establishing champions for information security 
efforts and as part of including the necessary resources, assign specialized expertise and resources 
as needed. Organizations may designate and empower an Investment Review Board (or similar 
group) to manage and provide oversight for the information security-related aspects of the capital 
planning and investment control process. Related controls: PM-4, SA-2.

PM-4 PLAN OF ACTION AND MILESTONES PROCESS  
Control:  The organization: 
a. Implements a process for ensuring that plans of action and milestones for the security 
program and associated organizational information systems: 
1. Are developed and maintained; 
2. Document the remedial information security actions to adequately respond to risk to 
organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation; and 
3. Are reported in accordance with OMB FISMA reporting requirements. 
b. Reviews plans of action and milestones for consistency with the organizational risk 
management strategy and organization-wide priorities for risk response actions. 
Supplemental Guidance:  The plan of action and milestones is a key document in the information 
security program and is subject to federal reporting requirements established by OMB. With the 
increasing emphasis on organization-wide risk management across all three tiers in the risk 
management hierarchy (i.e., organization, mission/business process, and information system), 
organizations view plans of action and milestones from an organizational perspective, prioritizing

PM-5 INFORMATION SYSTEM INVENTORY  
Control:  The organization develops and maintains an inventory of its information systems.  
Supplemental Guidance:  This control addresses the inventory requirements in FISMA. OMB 
provides guidance on developing information systems inventories and associated reporting 
requirements. For specific information system inventory reporting requirements, organizations 
consult OMB annual FISMA reporting guidance.

PM-6 INFORMATION SECURITY MEASURES OF PERFORMANCE 
Control:  The organization develops, monitors, and reports on the results of information security 
measures of performance. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Measures of performance are outcome-based metrics used by an 
organization to measure the effectiveness or efficiency of the information security program and 
the security controls employed in support of the program. 
Control Enhancements:  None.

PM-7 ENTERPRISE ARCHITECTURE  
Control:  The organization develops an enterprise architecture with consideration for information 
security and the resulting risk to organizational operations, organizational assets, individuals, other 
organizations, and the Nation.  
Supplemental Guidance:  The enterprise architecture developed by the organization is aligned with 
the Federal Enterprise Architecture. The integration of information security requirements and 
associated security controls into the organization’s enterprise architecture helps to ensure that 
security considerations are addressed by organizations early in the system development life cycle 
and are directly and explicitly related to the organization’s mission/business processes. This 
process of security requirements integration also embeds into the enterprise architecture, an 
integral information security architecture consistent with organizational risk management and 
information security strategies. For PM-7, the information security architecture is developed at a 
system-of-systems level (organization-wide), representing all of the organizational information 
systems. For PL-8, the information security architecture is developed at a level representing an 
individual information system but at the same time, is consistent with the information security 
architecture defined for the organization. Security requirements and security control integration 
are most effectively accomplished through the application of the Risk Management Framework 
and supporting security standards and guidelines. The Federal Segment Architecture Methodology 
provides guidance on integrating information security requirements and security controls into 
enterprise architectures. Related controls: PL-2, PL-8, PM-11, RA-2, SA-3.

PM-8 CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE PLAN  
Control:  The organization addresses information security issues in the development, 
documentation, and updating of a critical infrastructure and key resources protection plan.  
Supplemental Guidance:  Protection strategies are based on the prioritization of critical assets and 
resources. The requirement and guidance for defining critical infrastructure and key resources and 
for preparing an associated critical infrastructure protection plan are found in applicable federal 
laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance. Related 
controls: PM-1, PM-9, PM-11, RA-3. 
Control Enhancements:  None. 
References:  HSPD 7; National Infrastructure Protection Plan. 
PM-9 RISK MANAGEMENT STRATEGY  
Control:  The organization: 
a. Develops a comprehensive strategy to manage risk to organizational operations and assets, 
individuals, other organizations, and the Nation associated with the operation and use of 
information systems; 
b. Implements the risk management strategy consistently across the organization; and 
c. Reviews and updates the risk management strategy [Assignment: organization-defined 
frequency] or as required, to address organizational changes.  
Supplemental Guidance:  An organization-wide risk management strategy includes, for example, an 
unambiguous expression of the risk tolerance for the organization, acceptable risk assessment 
methodologies, risk mitigation strategies, a process for consistently evaluating risk across the 
organization with respect to the organization’s risk tolerance, and approaches for monitoring risk 
over time. The use of a risk executive function can facilitate consistent, organization-wide 
application of the risk management strategy. The organization-wide risk management strategy can 
be informed by risk-related inputs from other sources both internal and external to the organization 
to ensure the strategy is both broad-based and comprehensive. Related control: RA-3. 
Control Enhancements:  None.

PM-10 SECURITY AUTHORIZATION PROCESS  
Control:  The organization: 
a. Manages (i.e., documents, tracks, and reports) the security state of organizational information 
systems and the environments in which those systems operate through security authorization 
processes; 
b. Designates individuals to fulfill specific roles and responsibilities within the organizational 
risk management process; and 
c. Fully integrates the security authorization processes into an organization-wide risk 
management program. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Security authorization processes for information systems and environments 
of operation require the implementation of an organization-wide risk management process, a Risk 
Management Framework, and associated security standards and guidelines. Specific roles within 
the risk management process include an organizational risk executive (function) and designated 
authorizing officials for each organizational information system and common control provider. 
Security authorization processes are integrated with organizational continuous monitoring

PM-11 MISSION/BUSINESS PROCESS DEFINITION 
 Control:  The organization: 
a. Defines mission/business processes with consideration for information security and the 
resulting risk to organizational operations, organizational assets, individuals, other 
organizations, and the Nation; and 
b. Determines information protection needs arising from the defined mission/business processes 
and revises the processes as necessary, until achievable protection needs are obtained. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Information protection needs are technology-independent, required 
capabilities to counter threats to organizations, individuals, or the Nation through the compromise 
of information (i.e., loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability). Information protection needs 
are derived from the mission/business needs defined by the organization, the mission/business 
processes selected to meet the stated needs, and the organizational risk management strategy.  
Information protection needs determine the required security controls for the organization and the 
associated information systems supporting the mission/business processes. Inherent in defining an 
organization’s information protection needs is an understanding of the level of adverse impact that 
could result if a compromise of information occurs. The security categorization process is used to 
make such potential impact determinations. Mission/business process definitions and associated 
information protection requirements are documented by the organization in accordance with 
organizational policy and procedure. Related controls: PM-7, PM-8, RA-2. 
Control Enhancements:  None.

PM-12 INSIDER THREAT PROGRAM 
 Control:  The organization implements an insider threat program that includes a cross-discipline 
insider threat incident handling team. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Organizations handling classified information are required, under 
Executive Order 13587 and the National Policy on Insider Threat, to establish insider threat 
programs. The standards and guidelines that apply to insider threat programs in classified 
environments can also be employed effectively to improve the security of Controlled Unclassified 
Information in non-national security systems. Insider threat programs include security controls to 
detect and prevent malicious insider activity through the centralized integration and analysis of 
both technical and non-technical information to identify potential insider threat concerns. A senior 
organizational official is designated by the department/agency head as the responsible individual 
to implement and provide oversight for the program. In addition to the centralized integration and 
analysis capability, insider threat programs as a minimum, prepare department/agency insider 
threat policies and implementation plans, conduct host-based user monitoring of individual 
employee activities on government-owned classified computers, provide insider threat awareness 
training to employees, receive access to information from all offices within the department/agency 
(e.g., human resources, legal, physical security, personnel security, information technology, 
information system security, and law enforcement) for insider threat analysis, and conduct self-
assessments of department/agency insider threat posture. 
Insider threat programs can leverage the existence of incident handling teams organizations may 
already have in place, such as computer security incident response teams. Human resources

records are especially important in this effort, as there is compelling evidence to show that some 
types of insider crimes are often preceded by nontechnical behaviors in the workplace (e.g., 
ongoing patterns of disgruntled behavior and conflicts with coworkers and other colleagues). 
These precursors can better inform and guide organizational officials in more focused, targeted 
monitoring efforts. The participation of a legal team is important to ensure that all monitoring 
activities are performed in accordance with appropriate legislation, directives, regulations, 
policies, standards, and guidelines. Related controls: AC-6, AT-2, AU-6, AU-7- AU-10, AU-12,

PM-13 INFORMATION SECURITY WORKFORCE 
 Control:  The organization establishes an information security workforce development and 
improvement program. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Information security workforce development and improvement programs 
include, for example: (i) defining the knowledge and skill levels needed to perform information 
security duties and tasks; (ii) developing role-based training programs for individuals assigned 
information security roles and responsibilities; and (iii) providing standards for measuring and 
building individual qualifications for incumbents and applicants for information security-related 
positions. Such workforce programs can also include associated information security career paths 
to encourage: (i) information security professionals to advance in the field and fill positions with 
greater responsibility; and (ii) organizations to fill information security-related positions with 
qualified personnel. Information security workforce development and improvement programs are 
complementary to organizational security awareness and training programs. Information security 
workforce development and improvement programs focus on developing and institutionalizing 
core information security capabilities of selected personnel needed to protect organizational 
operations, assets, and individuals. Related controls: AT-2, AT-3. 
Control Enhancements:  None. 
References:  None. 
PM-14 TESTING, TRAINING, AND MONITORING  
Control:  The organization: 
a. Implements a process for ensuring that organizational plans for conducting security testing, 
training, and monitoring activities associated with organizational information systems: 
1. Are developed and maintained; and 
2. Continue to be executed in a timely manner; 
b. Reviews testing, training, and monitoring plans for consistency with the organizational risk 
management strategy and organization-wide priorities for risk response actions. 
Supplemental Guidance:  This control ensures that organizations provide oversight for the security 
testing, training, and monitoring activities conducted organization-wide and that those activities 
are coordinated. With the importance of continuous monitoring programs, the implementation of 
information security across the three tiers of the risk management hierarchy, and the widespread 
use of common controls, organizations coordinate and consolidate the testing and monitoring 
activities that are routinely conducted as part of ongoing organizational assessments supporting a 
variety of security controls. Security training activities, while typically focused on individual 
information systems and specific roles, also necessitate coordination across all organizational 
elements. Testing, training, and monitoring plans and activities are informed by current threat and 
vulnerability assessments. Related controls: AT-3, CA-7, CP-4, IR-3, SI-4.

PM-15 CONTACTS WITH SECURITY GROUPS AND ASSOCIATIONS 
Control:  The organization establishes and institutionalizes contact with selected groups and 
associations within the security community: 
a. To facilitate ongoing security education and training for organizational personnel; 
b. To maintain currency with recommended security practices, techniques, and technologies; and 
c. To share current security-related information including threats, vulnerabilities, and incidents. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Ongoing contact with security groups and associations is of paramount 
importance in an environment of rapidly changing technologies and threats. Security groups and 
associations include, for example, special interest groups, forums, professional associations, news 
groups, and/or peer groups of security professionals in similar organizations. Organizations select 
groups and associations based on organizational missions/business functions. Organizations share 
threat, vulnerability, and incident information consistent with applicable federal laws, Executive 
Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance. Related control: SI-5. 
Control Enhancements:  None. 
References:  None. 
PM-16 THREAT AWARENESS PROGRAM 
 Control:  The organization implements a threat awareness program that includes a cross-
organization information-sharing capability. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Because of the constantly changing and increasing sophistication of 
adversaries, especially the advanced persistent threat (APT), it is becoming more likely that 
adversaries may successfully breach or compromise organizational information systems. One of 
the best techniques to address this concern is for organizations to share threat information. This 
can include, for example, sharing threat events (i.e., tactics, techniques, and procedures) that 
organizations have experienced, mitigations that organizations have found are effective against 
certain types of threats, threat intelligence (i.e., indications and warnings about threats that are 
likely to occur). Threat information sharing may be bilateral (e.g., government-commercial 
cooperatives, government-government cooperatives), or multilateral (e.g., organizations taking 
part in threat-sharing consortia). Threat information may be highly sensitive requiring special 
agreements and protection, or less sensitive and freely shared. Related controls: PM-12, PM-16.

INTERNATIONAL INFORMATION SECURITY STANDARDS  
SECURITY CONTROL MAPPINGS FOR ISO/IEC 27001 AND 15408 
he mapping tables in this appendix provide organizations with a general indication of 
security control coverage with respect to ISO/IEC 27001, Information technology–Security 
techniques–Information security management systems–Requirements113 and ISO/IEC 
15408, Information technology -- Security techniques -- Evaluation criteria for IT security.114 
ISO/IEC 27001 applies to all types of organizations and specifies requirements for establishing, 
implementing, operating, monitoring, reviewing, maintaining, and improving a documented 
information security management system (ISMS) within the context of business risks. NIST 
Special Publication 800-39 includes guidance on managing risk at the organizational level, 
mission/business process level, and information system level, is consistent with ISO/IEC 27001, 
and provides additional implementation detail for the federal government and its contractors. 
ISO/IEC 15408 (also known as the Common Criteria) provides functionality and assurance 
requirements for developers of information systems and information system components (i.e., 
information technology products). Since many of the technical security controls defined in 
Appendix F are implemented in hardware, software, and firmware components of information 
systems, organizations can obtain significant benefit from the acquisition and employment of 
information technology products evaluated against the requirements of ISO/IEC 15408. The use 
of such products can provide evidence that certain security controls are implemented correctly, 
operating as intended, and producing the desired effect in satisfying stated security requirements.

APPENDIX H   PAGE H-2 
Table H-1 provides a mapping from the security controls in NIST Special Publication 800-53 to 
the security controls in ISO/IEC 27001. The mappings are created by using the primary security 
topic identified in each of the Special Publication 800-53 and searching for a similar security 
topic in ISO/IEC 27001. Security controls with similar functional meaning are included in the 
mapping table. For example, Special Publication 800-53 contingency planning and ISO/IEC 
27001 business continuity were deemed to have similar, but not the same, functionality. In some 
cases, similar topics are addressed in the security control sets but provide a different context, 
perspective, or scope. For example, Special Publication 800-53 addresses information flow 
control broadly in terms of approved authorizations for controlling access between source and 
destination objects, whereas ISO/IEC 27001 addresses the information flow more narrowly as it 
applies to interconnected network domains. Table H-2 provides a reverse mapping from the 
security controls in ISO/IEC 27001 to the security controls in Special Publication 800-53.115

APPENDIX H   PAGE H-12 
Table H-3 provides a generalized mapping from the functional and assurance requirements in 
ISO/IEC 15408 (Common Criteria) to the security controls in Special Publication 800-53. The 
table represents an informal correspondence between security requirements and security controls 
(i.e., the table is not intended to determine whether the ISO/IEC 15408 security requirements are 
fully, partially, or not satisfied by the associated security controls). However, the table can serve 
as a beneficial starting point for further correspondence analysis. Organizations are cautioned that 
satisfying ISO/IEC 15408 security requirements for an particular evaluated and validated 
information technology product as represented by the presence of certain security controls from 
Appendix F, does not imply that such requirements have been satisfied throughout the entire 
information system (which may consist of multiple, integrated individual component products). 
Additional information explaining the specific mappings that appear in Table H-3 is available at 
the National Information Assurance Partnership (NIAP) website at: http://www.niap-ccevs.org.

OVERLAY TEMPLATE 
APPLYING TAILORING GUIDANCE FOR SPECIAL CONDITIONS OR COMMUNITY-WIDE USE116 
rganizations may use the following template when developing tailored baselines using the 
concept of overlays.117 The template is provided as an example only—organizations may 
choose to use other formats or modify the format in this appendix based on organizational 
needs and the type of overlay being developed. The level of detail included in the overlay is at the 
discretion of the organization initiating the overlay but should be of sufficient breadth and depth 
to provide an appropriate rationale and justification for the resulting tailored baseline developed, 
including any risk-based decisions made during the overlay development process. Security 
control baseline tailoring using the concept of overlays results in security plans that are subject to 
approval by authorizing officials. The example template consists of eight sections: 
• Identification; 
• Overlay Characteristics; 
• Applicability; 
• Overlay Summary; 
• Detailed Overlay Control Specifications; 
• Tailoring Considerations; 
• Definitions; and 
• Additional Information or Instructions. 
How Overlays Can Be Used 
Within the Risk Management Framework (RMF), overlays are implemented as part of the 
tailoring process after the completion of an initial security categorization process described in 
Section 3.1 and any organization-specific guidance. The security categorization process results in 
the determination of an impact level of the information system, and is subsequently used to select 
an initial set of security controls from one of the security control baselines in Appendix D.118 
After the initial set of security controls is identified, organizations initiate the tailoring process to 
modify and align the controls more closely with the specific conditions within the organizations. 
Overlays provide tailoring guidance from a community-wide perspective to address specialized 
requirements, missions/business functions, technologies, or environments of operation. Overlays 
provide uniformity and efficiency of security control selection by presenting tailoring options 
                                                 
116 Tailored baselines produced using the concept of overlays can be published independently in a variety of venues and 
publications including, for example, OMB policies, CNSS Instructions, NIST Special Publications, industry standards, 
and sector-specific guidance. As part of the overlay initiative, the previous guidance in Appendix I regarding industrial 
and process control system security will be transferred to NIST Special Publication 800-82. 
117 While organizations are encouraged to use the overlay concept to tailor security control baselines, generating widely 
divergent overlays on the same topic may prove to be counterproductive. The overlay concept is most effective when 
communities of interest work together to create consensus-based overlays that are not duplicative. 
118 CNSS Instruction 1253 provides security categorization guidance and security control baselines for national security 
systems.

developed by security experts and other subject matter experts to information system owners 
responsible for implementing and maintaining such systems. 
There is a considerable range of options that can be used to construct overlays, depending on the 
specificity desired by the overlay developers. Some overlays may be very specific with respect to 
the hardware, firmware, and software that form the key components the information system and 
the environment in which the system operates. Other overlays may be more abstract in order to be 
applicable to a large class of information systems that may be deployed in different environments. 
The example template described below can be used for any level of specificity on this continuum 
of potential options for overlays. 
Overlays that provide greater specificity are typically developed by organizations with authority 
over the information system owners and environments of operation. Organizations decide on the 
appropriate tailoring actions for the selected baseline security controls as described in Section 3.2. 
Many of the variables and conditions that qualify the overlay for use on a specific information 
system are made explicit to ensure consistency when applying the overlay. Overlays that provide 
less specificity can also be developed by security and subject matter experts for application to 
large classes of information systems or in situations where there is less than full knowledge about 
the specific implementation details related to the system. Less specific overlays may require 
additional tailoring to customize the set of security controls for the specific information system. 
These overlays leave many of the assignment and selection statements in the security controls 
(i.e., the variable portion of the controls) to be completed by the organization that owns and 
operates the information system. The eight sections comprising the overlay are described below. 
Identification 
Organizations identify the overlay by providing: (i) a unique name for the overlay; (ii) a version 
number and date; (iii) the version of NIST Special Publication 800-53 used to create the overlay; 
(iv) other documentation used to create the overlay; (v) author or authoring group and point of 
contact; and (vi) type of organizational approval received. Organizations define how long the 
overlay is to be in effect and any events that may trigger an update to the overlay other than 
changes to NIST Special Publication 800-53 or organization-specific security guidance. If there 
are no unique events that can trigger an update for the overlay, this section provides that notation. 
Overlay Characteristics 
Organizations describe the characteristics that define the intended use of the overlay in order to 
help potential users select the most appropriate overlay for their missions/business functions. This 
may include, for example, a description of: (i) the environment in which the information system 
will be used (e.g., inside a guarded building within the continental United States, in an unmanned 
space vehicle, while traveling for business to a foreign country that is known for attempting to 
gain access to sensitive or classified information, or in a mobile vehicle that is in close proximity 
to hostile entities); (ii) the type of information that will be processed, stored, or transmitted (e.g., 
personal identity and authentication information, financial management information, facilities, 
fleet, and equipment management information, defense and national security information, system 
development information); (iii) the functionality within the information system or the type of 
system (e.g., standalone system, industrial/process control system, or cross-domain system); and 
(iv) other characteristics related to the overlay that help protect organizational missions/business 
functions, information systems, information, or individuals from a specific set of threats that may 
not be addressed by the assumptions described in Chapter Three.

________________________________________________________________________________________________ 
APPENDIX I   PAGE I-3 
Applicability 
Organizations provide criteria to assist potential users of the overlay in determining whether or 
not the overlay applies to a particular information system or environment of operation. Typical 
formats include, for example, a list of questions or a decision tree based on the description of the 
characteristics of the information system (including associated applications) and its environment 
of operation at the level of specificity appropriate to the overlay. 
Overlay Summary 
Organizations provide a brief summary of the salient characteristics of the overlay. This summary 
may include, for example: (i) the security controls and control enhancements that are affected by 
the overlay; (ii) an indication of which controls/enhancements are selected or not selected based 
on the characteristics and assumptions in the overlay, the tailoring guidance provided in Section 
3.2, or any organization-specific guidance; (iii) the selected controls/enhancements including an 
overview of new supplemental guidance and parameter values; and (iv) references to applicable 
laws, Executive Orders, directives, instructions, regulations, policies, or standards.   
Detailed Overlay Control Specifications 
Organizations provide a comprehensive expression of the security controls/control enhancements 
in the overlay as part of the tailoring process. This may include, for example: (i) justification for 
selecting or not selecting a specific security control/control enhancement; (ii) modifications to the 
supplemental guidance or the addition of new supplemental guidance for the security controls and 
control enhancements to address the characteristics of the overlay and the environments in which 
the overlay is intended to operate; (iii) unique parameter values for security control selection or 
assignment statements; (iv) specific statutory and/or regulatory requirements (above and beyond 
FISMA) that are met by a security control or control enhancement; (v) recommendations for 
compensating controls, as appropriate; and (vi) guidance that extends the basic capability of the 
control/enhancement by specifying additional functionality, altering the strength of mechanism, 
or adding or limiting implementation options. 
Tailoring Considerations 
Organizations provide information to information system owners and authorizing officials to 
consider during the tailoring process when determining the set of security controls applicable to 
their specific information systems. This is especially important for overlays that are used in an 
environment of operation different from the one assumed by the security control baselines (as 
defined in Section 3.1). In addition, organizations can provide guidance on the use of multiple 
overlays applied to a security control baseline and address any potential conflicts that may arise 
between overlay specifications and baseline controls. 
Definitions 
Organizations provide any terms and associated definitions that are unique and relevant to the 
overlay. The terms and definitions are listed in alphabetical order. If there are no unique terms or 
definitions for the overlay, this is stated in this section. 
Additional Information or Instructions   
Organizations provide any additional information or instructions relevant to the overlay not 
covered in the previous sections.

PRIVACY CONTROL CATALOG  
PRIVACY CONTROLS, ENHANCEMENTS, AND SUPPLEMENTAL GUIDANCE 
he need to protect an individual's privacy is as important today as it was in 1974 when the 
Privacy Act first sought to balance the government's need to collect information from an 
individual with a citizen's right to be notified as to how that information was being used, 
collected, maintained, and disposed of after the requisite period of use. These concerns are also 
shared in the private sector, where healthcare, financial, and other services continue to be 
delivered via the web with increasingly higher levels of personalization. The proliferation of 
social media, Smart Grid, mobile, and cloud computing, as well as the transition from structured 
to unstructured data and metadata environments, have added significant complexities and 
challenges for federal organizations in safeguarding privacy. These challenges extend well 
beyond the traditional information technology security view of protecting privacy which focused 
primarily on ensuring confidentiality. Now there are greater implications with respect to 
controlling the integrity of an individual's information, and with ensuring that an individual's 
information is available on demand. The challenging landscape requires federal organizations to 
expand their view of privacy, in order to meet citizen expectations of privacy that go beyond 
information security. 
Privacy, with respect to personally identifiable information (PII),119 is a core value that can be 
obtained only with appropriate legislation, policies, procedures, and associated controls to ensure 
compliance with requirements. Protecting the privacy of individuals and their PII that is collected, 
used, maintained, shared, and disposed of by programs and information systems, is a fundamental 
responsibility of federal organizations. Privacy also involves each individual’s right to decide 
when and whether to share personal information, how much information to share, and the 
particular circumstances under which that information can be shared. In today’s digital world, 
effective privacy for individuals depends on the safeguards employed within the information 
systems that are processing, storing, and transmitting PII and the environments in which those 
systems operate. Organizations cannot have effective privacy without a basic foundation of 
information security. Privacy is more than security, however, and includes, for example, the 
principles of transparency, notice, and choice. 
This appendix provides a structured set of controls for protecting privacy and serves as a roadmap 
for organizations to use in identifying and implementing privacy controls concerning the entire 
life cycle of PII, whether in paper or electronic form. The controls focus on information privacy 
as a value distinct from, but highly interrelated with, information security. Privacy controls are 
                                                 
119 OMB Memorandum 07-16 defines PII as information which can be used to distinguish or trace an individual’s 
identity such as their name, social security number, biometric records, etc., alone, or when combined with other 
personal or identifying information which is linked or linkable to a specific individual, such as date and place of birth, 
mother’s maiden name, etc. OMB Memorandum 10-22 further states that “the definition of PII is not anchored to any 
single category of information or technology. Rather, it requires a case-by-case assessment of the specific risk that an 
individual can be identified by examining the context of use and combination of data elements. In performing this 
assessment, it is important for agencies to recognize that non-PII can become PII, whenever additional information is 
made publicly available, in any medium and from any source that, when combined with other available information, 
could be used to identify an individual.” NIST Special Publication 800-122 also includes a definition of PII that differs 
from this appendix because it was focused on the security objective of confidentiality and not privacy in the broad 
sense. Organizational definitions of PII may vary based on the consideration of additional regulatory requirements. The 
privacy controls in this appendix apply regardless of the definition of PII by organizations.

the administrative, technical, and physical safeguards employed within organizations to protect 
and ensure the proper handling of PII.120 Organizations may also engage in activities that do not 
involve the collection and use of PII, but may nevertheless raise privacy concerns and associated 
risk. The privacy controls are equally applicable to those activities and can be used to analyze the 
privacy risk and mitigate such risk when necessary. 
The privacy controls in this appendix are based on the Fair Information Practice Principles 
(FIPPs)121 embodied in the Privacy Act of 1974, Section 208 of the E-Government Act of 2002, 
and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) policies. The FIPPs are designed to build public 
trust in the privacy practices of organizations and to help organizations avoid tangible costs and 
intangible damages from privacy incidents. There are eight privacy control families, each aligning 
with one of the FIPPs. The privacy families can be implemented at the organization, department, 
agency, component, office, program, or information system level, under the leadership and 
oversight of the Senior Agency Official for Privacy (SAOP)/Chief Privacy Officer (CPO)122 and 
in coordination with the Chief Information Security Officer, Chief Information Officer, program 
officials, legal counsel, and others as appropriate. Table J-1 provides a summary of the privacy 
controls by family in the privacy control catalog.

120 In 2010, the Federal CIO Council Privacy Committee issued a framework for designing and implementing a privacy 
program entitled Best Practices: Elements of a Federal Privacy Program (Elements White Paper). The privacy controls 
in this appendix mirror a number of the elements included in the paper. Organizations can use the privacy controls and 
the guidance in the paper to develop an organization-wide privacy program or enhance an already existing program.  
121 The FIPPs are widely accepted in the United States and internationally as a general framework for privacy and are 
reflected in other federal and international laws and policies. In a number of organizations, FIPPs serve as the basis for 
analyzing privacy risks and determining appropriate mitigation strategies. The Federal Enterprise Architecture Security 
and Privacy Profile (FEA-SPP) also provided information and materials in development of the privacy controls. 
122 All federal agencies and departments designate an SAOP/CPO as the senior organizational official with the overall 
organization-wide responsibility for information privacy issues. OMB Memorandum 05-08 provides guidance for the 
designation of SAOPs/CPOs. The term SAOP/CPO as used in this appendix means an organization’s senior privacy 
leader, whose job title may vary from organization to organization.

There is a strong similarity between the structure of the privacy controls in this appendix and the 
structure of the security controls in Appendices F and G. For example, the control AR-1 
(Governance and Privacy Program) requires organizations to develop privacy plans that can be 
implemented at the organizational or program level. These plans can also be used in conjunction 
with security plans to provide an opportunity for organizations to select the appropriate set of 
security and privacy controls in accordance with organizational mission/business requirements 
and the environments in which the organizations operate. Incorporating the fundamental concepts 
associated with managing information security risk helps to ensure that the employment of 
privacy controls is carried out in a cost-effective and risk-based manner while simultaneously 
meeting compliance requirements. Standardized privacy controls and assessment procedures 
(developed to evaluate the effectiveness of the controls) will provide a more disciplined and 
structured approach for satisfying federal privacy requirements and demonstrating compliance 
with those requirements. 
In summary, the Privacy Appendix achieves several important objectives. The appendix: 
• Provides a structured set of privacy controls, based on best practices, that helps organizations 
comply with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, instructions, regulations, 
policies, standards, guidance, and organization-specific issuances; 
• Establishes a linkage and relationship between privacy and security controls for purposes of 
enforcing respective privacy and security requirements that may overlap in concept and in 
implementation within federal information systems, programs, and organizations; 
• Demonstrates the applicability of the NIST Risk Management Framework in the selection, 
implementation, assessment, and ongoing monitoring of privacy controls deployed in federal 
information systems, programs, and organizations; and 
• Promotes closer cooperation between privacy and security officials within the federal 
government to help achieve the objectives of senior leaders/executives in enforcing the 
requirements in federal privacy legislation, policies, regulations, directives, standards, and 
guidance.

HOW TO USE THIS APPENDIX 
The privacy controls outlined in this publication are primarily for use by an organization’s  Senior 
Agency Official for Privacy (SAOP)/Chief Privacy Officer (CPO) when working with program 
managers, mission/business owners, information owners/stewards, Chief Information Officers, 
Chief Information Security Officers, information system developers/integrators, and risk executives 
to determine how best to incorporate effective privacy protections and practices (i.e., privacy 
controls) within organizational programs and information systems and the environments in which 
they operate. The privacy controls facilitate the organization’s efforts to comply with privacy 
requirements affecting those organizational programs and/or systems that collect, use, maintain, 
share, or dispose of personally identifiable information (PII) or other activities that raise privacy 
risks. While the security controls in Appendix F are allocated to the low, moderate, and high 
baselines in Appendix D, the privacy controls are selected and implemented based on the privacy 
requirements of organizations and the need to protect the PII of individuals collected and 
maintained by organizational information systems and programs, in accordance with federal privacy 
legislation, policies, directives, regulations, guidelines, and best practices. 
Organizations analyze and apply each privacy control with respect to their distinct mission/business 
and operational needs based on their legal authorities and obligations. Implementation of the 
privacy controls may vary based upon this analysis (e.g., organizations that are defined as covered 
entities pursuant to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act [HIPAA] may have 
additional requirements that are not specifically enumerated in this publication). This enables 
organizations to determine the information practices that are compliant with law and policy and 
those that may need review. It also enables organizations to tailor the privacy controls to meet their 
defined and specific needs at the organization level, mission/business process level, and information 
system level. Organizations with national security or law enforcement authorities take those 
authorities as well as privacy interests into account in determining how to apply the privacy controls 
in their operational environments. Similarly, organizations subject to the Confidential Information 
Protection and Statistical Efficiency Act (CIPSEA), implement the privacy controls consistent with 
that Act. All organizations implement the privacy controls consistent with the Privacy Act of 1974, 
5 U.S.C. § 552a, subject to any exceptions and/or exemptions. 
Privacy control enhancements described in Appendix J reflect best practices which organizations 
should strive to achieve, but are not mandatory. Organizations should decide when to apply control 
enhancements to support their particular missions/business functions. Specific overlays for privacy, 
developed in accordance with the guidance in Section 3.2 and Appendix I, can also be considered to 
facilitate the tailoring of the security control baselines in Appendix D with the requisite privacy 
controls to ensure that both security and privacy requirements can be satisfied by organizations. 
Many of the security controls in Appendix F provide the fundamental information protection for 
confidentiality, integrity, and availability within organizational information systems and the 
environments in which those systems operate—protection that is essential for strong and effective 
privacy. 
Organizations document the agreed upon privacy controls to be implemented in organizational 
programs and information systems and the environments in which they operate. At the discretion of 
the implementing organization, privacy controls may be documented in a distinct privacy plan or 
incorporated into other risk management documents (e.g., system security plans). Organizations 
also establish appropriate assessment methodologies to determine the extent to which the privacy 
controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with 
respect to meeting designated privacy requirements. Organizational assessments of privacy controls 
can be conducted either by the SAOP/CPO alone or jointly with the other organizational risk 
management offices including the information security office.

Implementation Tip 
• Select and implement privacy controls based on the privacy requirements of organizations and 
the need to protect the personally identifiable information (PII) of individuals collected and 
maintained by systems and programs. 
• Coordinate privacy control selection and implementation with the organizational Risk Executive 
Function, mission/business owners, enterprise architects, Chief Information Officer, SAOP/CPO, 
and Chief Information Security Officer. 
• View the privacy controls in Appendix J from the same perspective as the Program 
Management controls in Appendix G—that is, the controls are implemented for each 
organizational information system irrespective of the FIPS 199 categorization for that system. 
• Select and implement the optional privacy control enhancements when there is a demonstrated 
need for additional privacy protection for individuals and PII. 
• Apply the privacy controls consistent with any specific exceptions and exemptions included in 
legislation, Executive Orders, directives, policies, and regulations (e.g., law enforcement or 
national security considerations).

FAMILY:  AUTHORITY AND PURPOSE 
This family ensures that organizations: (i) identify the legal bases that authorize a particular personally 
identifiable information (PII) collection or activity that impacts privacy; and (ii) specify in their notices 
the purpose(s) for which PII is collected. 
AP-1 AUTHORITY TO COLLECT 
Control:  The organization determines and documents the legal authority that permits the collection, 
use, maintenance, and sharing of personally identifiable information (PII), either generally or in 
support of a specific program or information system need. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Before collecting PII, the organization determines whether the 
contemplated collection of PII is legally authorized. Program officials consult with the Senior 
Agency Official for Privacy (SAOP)/Chief Privacy Officer (CPO) and legal counsel regarding the 
authority of any program or activity to collect PII. The authority to collect PII is documented in 
the System of Records Notice (SORN) and/or Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) or other 
applicable documentation such as Privacy Act Statements or Computer Matching Agreements. 
Related controls: AR-2, DM-1, TR-1, TR-2. 
Control Enhancements:  None. 
References:  The Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. § 552a (e); Section 208(c), E-Government Act of 
2002 (P.L. 107-347); OMB Circular A-130, Appendix I. 
AP-2 PURPOSE SPECIFICATION 
Control:  The organization describes the purpose(s) for which personally identifiable information 
(PII) is collected, used, maintained, and shared in its privacy notices. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Often, statutory language expressly authorizes specific collections and uses 
of PII. When statutory language is written broadly and thus subject to interpretation, organizations 
ensure, in consultation with the Senior Agency Official for Privacy (SAOP)/Chief Privacy Officer 
(CPO) and legal counsel, that there is a close nexus between the general authorization and any 
specific collection of PII. Once the specific purposes have been identified, the purposes are clearly 
described in the related privacy compliance documentation, including but not limited to Privacy 
Impact Assessments (PIAs), System of Records Notices (SORNs), and Privacy Act Statements 
provided at the time of collection (e.g., on forms organizations use to collect PII). Further, in order 
to avoid unauthorized collections or uses of PII, personnel who handle PII receive training on the 
organizational authorities for collecting PII, authorized uses of PII, and on the contents of the 
notice. Related controls: AR-2, AR-4, AR-5, DM-1, DM-2, TR-1, TR-2, UL-1, UL-2.

APPENDIX J   PAGE J-7 
FAMILY:  ACCOUNTABILITY, AUDIT, AND RISK MANAGEMENT 
This family enhances public confidence through effective controls for governance, monitoring, risk 
management, and assessment to demonstrate that organizations are complying with applicable privacy 
protection requirements and minimizing overall privacy risk. 
AR-1 GOVERNANCE AND PRIVACY PROGRAM 
Control:  The organization:  
a. Appoints a Senior Agency Official for Privacy (SAOP)/Chief Privacy Officer (CPO) 
accountable for developing, implementing, and maintaining an organization-wide governance 
and privacy program to ensure compliance with all applicable laws and regulations regarding 
the collection, use, maintenance, sharing, and disposal of personally identifiable information 
(PII) by programs and information systems; 
b. Monitors federal privacy laws and policy for changes that affect the privacy program; 
c. Allocates [Assignment: organization-defined allocation of budget and staffing] sufficient 
resources to implement and operate the organization-wide privacy program; 
d. Develops a strategic organizational privacy plan for implementing applicable privacy 
controls, policies, and procedures; 
e. Develops, disseminates, and implements operational privacy policies and procedures that 
govern the appropriate privacy and security controls for programs, information systems, or 
technologies involving PII; and 
f. Updates privacy plan, policies, and procedures [Assignment: organization-defined frequency, 
at least biennially]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  The development and implementation of a comprehensive governance and 
privacy program demonstrates organizational accountability for and commitment to the protection 
of individual privacy. Accountability begins with the appointment of an SAOP/CPO with the 
authority, mission, resources, and responsibility to develop and implement a multifaceted privacy 
program. The SAOP/CPO, in consultation with legal counsel, information security officials, and 
others as appropriate: (i) ensures the development, implementation, and enforcement of privacy 
policies and procedures; (ii) defines roles and responsibilities for protecting PII; (iii) determines 
the level of information sensitivity with regard to PII holdings; (iv) identifies the laws, regulations, 
and internal policies that apply to the PII; (v) monitors privacy best practices; and (vi) 
monitors/audits compliance with identified privacy controls.   
To further accountability, the SAOP/CPO develops privacy plans to document the privacy 
requirements of organizations and the privacy and security controls in place or planned for 
meeting those requirements. The plan serves as evidence of organizational privacy operations and 
supports resource requests by the SAOP/CPO. A single plan or multiple plans may be necessary 
depending upon the organizational structures, requirements, and resources, and the plan(s) may 
vary in comprehensiveness. For example, a one-page privacy plan may cover privacy policies, 
documentation, and controls already in place, such as Privacy Impact Assessments (PIA) and 
System of Records Notices (SORN). A comprehensive plan may include a baseline of privacy 
controls selected from this appendix and include: (i) processes for conducting privacy risk 
assessments; (ii) templates and guidance for completing PIAs and SORNs; (iii) privacy training 
and awareness requirements; (iv) requirements for contractors processing PII; (v) plans for 
eliminating unnecessary PII holdings; and (vi) a framework for measuring annual performance 
goals and objectives for implementing identified privacy controls.

Memoranda 03-22, 05-08, 07-16; OMB Circular A-130; Federal Enterprise Architecture Security 
and Privacy Profile. 
AR-2 PRIVACY IMPACT AND RISK ASSESSMENT 
Control:  The organization:  
a. Documents and implements a privacy risk management process that assesses privacy risk to 
individuals resulting from the collection, sharing, storing, transmitting, use, and disposal of 
personally identifiable information (PII); and 
b. Conducts Privacy Impact Assessments (PIAs) for information systems, programs, or other 
activities that pose a privacy risk in accordance with applicable law, OMB policy, or any 
existing organizational policies and procedures. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Organizational privacy risk management processes operate across the life 
cycles of all mission/business processes that collect, use, maintain, share, or dispose of PII. The 
tools and processes for managing risk are specific to organizational missions and resources. They 
include, but are not limited to, the conduct of PIAs. The PIA is both a process and the document 
that is the outcome of that process. OMB Memorandum 03-22 provides guidance to organizations 
for implementing the privacy provisions of the E-Government Act of 2002, including guidance on 
when PIAs are required for information systems. Some organizations may be required by law or 
policy to extend the PIA requirement to other activities involving PII or otherwise impacting 
privacy (e.g., programs, projects, or regulations). PIAs are conducted to identify privacy risks and 
identify methods to mitigate those risks. PIAs are also conducted to ensure that programs or 
information systems comply with legal, regulatory, and policy requirements. PIAs also serve as 
notice to the public of privacy practices. PIAs are performed before developing or procuring 
information systems, or initiating programs or projects, that collect, use, maintain, or share PII and 
are updated when changes create new privacy risks.

AR-3 PRIVACY REQUIREMENTS FOR CONTRACTORS AND SERVICE PROVIDERS 
Control:  The organization:  
a. Establishes privacy roles, responsibilities, and access requirements for contractors and service 
providers; and 
b. Includes privacy requirements in contracts and other acquisition-related documents. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Contractors and service providers include, but are not limited to, 
information providers, information processors, and other organizations providing information 
system development, information technology services, and other outsourced 
applications. Organizations consult with legal counsel, the Senior Agency Official for Privacy 
(SAOP)/Chief Privacy Officer (CPO), and contracting officers about applicable laws, directives, 
policies, or regulations that may impact implementation of this control. Related control: AR-1, 
AR-5, SA-4.

APPENDIX J   PAGE J-9 
AR-4 PRIVACY MONITORING AND AUDITING 
Control:  The organization monitors and audits privacy controls and internal privacy policy 
[Assignment: organization-defined frequency] to ensure effective implementation. 
Supplemental Guidance:  To promote accountability, organizations identify and address gaps in 
privacy compliance, management, operational, and technical controls by conducting regular 
assessments (e.g., internal risk assessments). These assessments can be self-assessments or third-
party audits that result in reports on compliance gaps identified in programs, projects, and 
information systems. In addition to auditing for effective implementation of all privacy controls 
identified in this appendix, organizations assess whether they: (i) implement a process to embed 
privacy considerations into the life cycle of personally identifiable information (PII), programs, 
information systems, mission/business processes, and technology; (ii) monitor for changes to 
applicable privacy laws, regulations, and policies; (iii) track programs, information systems, and 
applications that collect and maintain PII to ensure compliance; (iv) ensure that access to PII is 
only on a need-to-know basis; and (v) ensure that PII is being maintained and used only for the 
legally authorized purposes identified in the public notice(s).  
Organizations also: (i) implement technology to audit for the security, appropriate use, and loss of 
PII; (ii) perform reviews to ensure physical security of documents containing PII; (iii) assess 
contractor compliance with privacy requirements; and (iv) ensure that corrective actions identified 
as part of the assessment process are tracked and monitored until audit findings are corrected. The 
organization Senior Agency Official for Privacy (SAOP)/Chief Privacy Officer (CPO) coordinates 
monitoring and auditing efforts with information security officials and ensures that the results are 
provided to senior managers and oversight officials. Related controls: AR-6, AR-7, AU-1, AU-2,

OMB Memoranda 03-22, 05-08, 06-16, 07-16; OMB Circular A-130. 
AR-5 PRIVACY AWARENESS AND TRAINING 
Control:  The organization:  
a. Develops, implements, and updates a comprehensive training and awareness strategy aimed at 
ensuring that personnel understand privacy responsibilities and procedures; 
b. Administers basic privacy training [Assignment: organization-defined frequency, at least 
annually] and targeted, role-based privacy training for personnel having responsibility for 
personally identifiable information (PII) or for activities that involve PII [Assignment: 
organization-defined frequency, at least annually]; and 
c. Ensures that personnel certify (manually or electronically) acceptance of responsibilities for 
privacy requirements [Assignment: organization-defined frequency, at least annually]. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Through implementation of a privacy training and awareness strategy, the 
organization promotes a culture of privacy. Privacy training and awareness programs typically 
focus on broad topics, such as responsibilities under the Privacy Act of 1974 and E-Government 
Act of 2002 and the consequences of failing to carry out those responsibilities, how to identify 
new privacy risks, how to mitigate privacy risks, and how and when to report privacy incidents. 
Privacy training may also target data collection and use requirements identified in public notices, 
such as Privacy Impact Assessments (PIAs) or System of Records Notices (SORNs) for a program 
or information system. Specific training methods may include: (i) mandatory annual privacy 
awareness training; (ii) targeted, role-based training; (iii) internal privacy program websites; (iv) 
manuals, guides, and handbooks; (v) slide presentations; (vi) events (e.g., privacy awareness week, 
privacy clean-up day); (vii) posters and brochures; and (viii) email messages to all employees and 
contractors. Organizations update training based on changing statutory, regulatory, mission,

AR-6 PRIVACY REPORTING 
Control:  The organization develops, disseminates, and updates reports to the Office of 
Management and Budget (OMB), Congress, and other oversight bodies, as appropriate, to 
demonstrate accountability with specific statutory and regulatory privacy program mandates, and 
to senior management and other personnel with responsibility for monitoring privacy program 
progress and compliance. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Through internal and external privacy reporting, organizations promote 
accountability and transparency in organizational privacy operations. Reporting also helps 
organizations to determine progress in meeting privacy compliance requirements and privacy 
controls, compare performance across the federal government, identify vulnerabilities and gaps in 
policy and implementation, and identify success models. Types of privacy reports include: (i) 
annual Senior Agency Official for Privacy (SAOP) reports to OMB; (ii) reports to Congress 
required by the Implementing Regulations of the 9/11 Commission Act; and (iii) other public 
reports required by specific statutory mandates or internal policies of organizations. The 
organization Senior Agency Official for Privacy (SAOP)/Chief Privacy Officer (CPO) consults 
with legal counsel, where appropriate, to ensure that organizations meet all applicable privacy 
reporting requirements.

AR-7 PRIVACY-ENHANCED SYSTEM DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT 
Control:  The organization designs information systems to support privacy by automating privacy 
controls. 
Supplemental Guidance:  To the extent feasible, when designing organizational information systems, 
organizations employ technologies and system capabilities that automate privacy controls on the 
collection, use, retention, and disclosure of personally identifiable information (PII). By building 
privacy controls into system design and development, organizations mitigate privacy risks to PII, 
thereby reducing the likelihood of information system breaches and other privacy-related 
incidents. Organizations also conduct periodic reviews of systems to determine the need for 
updates to maintain compliance with the Privacy Act and the organization’s privacy policy. 
Regardless of whether automated privacy controls are employed, organizations regularly monitor 
information system use and sharing of PII to ensure that the use/sharing is consistent with the 
authorized purposes identified in the Privacy Act and/or in the public notice of organizations, or in 
a manner compatible with those purposes. Related controls: AC-6, AR-4, AR-5, DM-2, TR-1.

AR-8 ACCOUNTING OF DISCLOSURES 
Control:  The organization:  
a. Keeps an accurate accounting of disclosures of information held in each system of records 
under its control, including: 
(1) Date, nature, and purpose of each disclosure of a record; and 
(2) Name and address of the person or agency to which the disclosure was made; 
b. Retains the accounting of disclosures for the life of the record or five years after the 
disclosure is made, whichever is longer; and 
c. Makes the accounting of disclosures available to the person named in the record upon request. 
Supplemental Guidance:  The Senior Agency Official for Privacy (SAOP)/Chief Privacy Officer 
(CPO) periodically consults with managers of organization systems of record to ensure that the 
required accountings of disclosures of records are being properly maintained and provided to 
persons named in those records consistent with the dictates of the Privacy Act. Organizations are 
not required to keep an accounting of disclosures when the disclosures are made to individuals 
with a need to know, are made pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, or are made to a law 
enforcement agency pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 552a(c)(3). Heads of agencies can promulgate rules to 
exempt certain systems of records from the requirement to provide the accounting of disclosures to 
individuals. Related control: IP-2.

FAMILY:  DATA QUALITY AND INTEGRITY 
This family enhances public confidence that any personally identifiable information (PII) collected and 
maintained by organizations is accurate, relevant, timely, and complete for the purpose for which it is to 
be used, as specified in public notices. 
DI-1 DATA QUALITY 
Control:  The organization:  
a. Confirms to the greatest extent practicable upon collection or creation of personally 
identifiable information (PII), the accuracy, relevance, timeliness, and completeness of that 
information; 
b. Collects PII directly from the individual to the greatest extent practicable; 
c. Checks for, and corrects as necessary, any inaccurate or outdated PII used by its programs or 
systems [Assignment: organization-defined frequency]; and 
d. Issues guidelines ensuring and maximizing the quality, utility, objectivity, and integrity of 
disseminated information.   
Supplemental Guidance:  Organizations take reasonable steps to confirm the accuracy and relevance 
of PII. Such steps may include, for example, editing and validating addresses as they are collected 
or entered into information systems using automated address verification look-up application 
programming interfaces (API). The types of measures taken to protect data quality are based on 
the nature and context of the PII, how it is to be used, and how it was obtained. Measures taken to 
validate the accuracy of PII that is used to make determinations about the rights, benefits, or 
privileges of individuals under federal programs may be more comprehensive than those used to 
validate less sensitive PII. Additional steps may be necessary to validate PII that is obtained from 
sources other than individuals or the authorized representatives of individuals. 
When PII is of a sufficiently sensitive nature (e.g., when it is used for annual reconfirmation of a 
taxpayer’s income for a recurring benefit), organizations incorporate mechanisms into information 
systems and develop corresponding procedures for how frequently, and by what method, the 
information is to be updated. Related controls: AP-2, DI-2, DM-1, IP-3, SI-10. 
Control Enhancements: 
(1) DATA QUALITY | VALIDATE PII  
The organization requests that the individual or individual’s authorized representative validate PII

b. Establishes a Data Integrity Board when appropriate to oversee organizational Computer 
Matching Agreements123 and to ensure that those agreements comply with the computer 
matching provisions of the Privacy Act. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Organizations conducting or participating in Computer Matching 
Agreements with other organizations regarding applicants for and recipients of financial assistance 
or payments under federal benefit programs or regarding certain computerized comparisons 
involving federal personnel or payroll records establish a Data Integrity Board to oversee and 
coordinate their implementation of such matching agreements. In many organizations, the Data 
Integrity Board is led by the Senior Agency Official for Privacy (SAOP)/Chief Privacy Officer 
(CPO). The Data Integrity Board ensures that controls are in place to maintain both the quality and 
the integrity of data shared under Computer Matching Agreements. Related controls: AC-1, AC-3,

FAMILY:  DATA MINIMIZATION AND RETENTION 
This family helps organizations implement the data minimization and retention requirements to collect, 
use, and retain only personally identifiable information (PII) that is relevant and necessary for the 
purpose for which it was originally collected. Organizations retain PII for only as long as necessary to 
fulfill the purpose(s) specified in public notices and in accordance with a National Archives and Records 
Administration (NARA)-approved record retention schedule. 
DM-1 MINIMIZATION OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION 
Control:  The organization:  
a. Identifies the minimum personally identifiable information (PII) elements that are relevant 
and necessary to accomplish the legally authorized purpose of collection; 
b. Limits the collection and retention of PII to the minimum elements identified for the purposes 
described in the notice and for which the individual has provided consent; and  
c. Conducts an initial evaluation of PII holdings and establishes and follows a schedule for 
regularly reviewing those holdings [Assignment: organization-defined frequency, at least 
annually] to ensure that only PII identified in the notice is collected and retained, and that the 
PII continues to be necessary to accomplish the legally authorized purpose. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Organizations take appropriate steps to ensure that the collection of PII is 
consistent with a purpose authorized by law or regulation. The minimum set of PII elements 
required to support a specific organization business process may be a subset of the PII the 
organization is authorized to collect. Program officials consult with the Senior Agency Official for 
Privacy (SAOP)/Chief Privacy Officer (CPO) and legal counsel to identify the minimum PII 
elements required by the information system or activity to accomplish the legally authorized 
purpose. 
Organizations can further reduce their privacy and security risks by also reducing their inventory 
of PII, where appropriate. OMB Memorandum 07-16 requires organizations to conduct both an 
initial review and subsequent reviews of their holdings of all PII and ensure, to the maximum 
extent practicable, that such holdings are accurate, relevant, timely, and complete. Organizations 
are also directed by OMB to reduce their holdings to the minimum necessary for the proper 
performance of a documented organizational business purpose. OMB Memorandum 07-16 
requires organizations to develop and publicize, either through a notice in the Federal Register or 
on their websites, a schedule for periodic reviews of their holdings to supplement the initial 
review. Organizations coordinate with their federal records officers to ensure that reductions in 
organizational holdings of PII are consistent with NARA retention schedules. 
By performing periodic evaluations, organizations reduce risk, ensure that they are collecting only 
the data specified in the notice, and ensure that the data collected is still relevant and necessary for 
the purpose(s) specified in the notice. Related controls: AP-1, AP-2, AR-4, IP-1, SE-1, SI-12, TR-

b. Disposes of, destroys, erases, and/or anonymizes the PII, regardless of the method of storage, 
in accordance with a NARA-approved record retention schedule and in a manner that prevents 
loss, theft, misuse, or unauthorized access; and 
c. Uses [Assignment: organization-defined techniques or methods] to ensure secure deletion or 
destruction of PII (including originals, copies, and archived records).   
Supplemental Guidance:  NARA provides retention schedules that govern the disposition of federal 
records. Program officials coordinate with records officers and with NARA to identify appropriate 
retention periods and disposal methods. NARA may require organizations to retain PII longer than 
is operationally needed. In those situations, organizations describe such requirements in the notice. 
Methods of storage include, for example, electronic, optical media, or paper. 
Examples of ways organizations may reduce holdings include reducing the types of PII held (e.g., 
delete Social Security numbers if their use is no longer needed) or shortening the retention period 
for PII that is maintained if it is no longer necessary to keep PII for long periods of time (this 
effort is undertaken in consultation with an organization’s records officer to receive NARA 
approval). In both examples, organizations provide notice (e.g., an updated System of Records 
Notice) to inform the public of any changes in holdings of PII. 
Certain read-only archiving techniques, such as DVDs, CDs, microfilm, or microfiche, may not 
permit the removal of individual records without the destruction of the entire database contained 
on such media. Related controls: AR-4, AU-11, DM-1, MP-1, MP-2, MP-3, MP-4, MP-5, MP-6, 
MP-7, MP-8, SI-12, TR-1. 
Control Enhancements: 
(1) DATA RETENTION AND DISPOSAL | SYSTEM CONFIGURATION  
The organization, where feasible, configures its information systems to record the date PII is 
collected, created, or updated and when PII is to be deleted or archived under an approved record 
retention schedule.

DM-3 MINIMIZATION OF PII USED IN TESTING, TRAINING, AND RESEARCH 
Control:  The organization:  
a. Develops policies and procedures that minimize the use of personally identifiable information 
(PII) for testing, training, and research; and 
b. Implements controls to protect PII used for testing, training, and research. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Organizations often use PII for testing new applications or information 
systems prior to deployment. Organizations also use PII for research purposes and for training. 
The use of PII in testing, research, and training increases risk of unauthorized disclosure or misuse 
of the information. If PII must be used, organizations take measures to minimize any associated 
risks and to authorize the use of and limit the amount of PII for these purposes. Organizations 
consult with the SAOP/CPO and legal counsel to ensure that the use of PII in testing, training, and 
research is compatible with the original purpose for which it was collected.

APPENDIX J   PAGE J-17 
FAMILY:  INDIVIDUAL PARTICIPATION AND REDRESS 
This family addresses the need to make individuals active participants in the decision-making process 
regarding the collection and use of their personally identifiable information (PII). By providing 
individuals with access to PII and the ability to have their PII corrected or amended, as appropriate, the 
controls in this family enhance public confidence in organizational decisions made based on the PII. 
IP-1 CONSENT 
Control:  The organization:  
a. Provides means, where feasible and appropriate, for individuals to authorize the collection, 
use, maintaining, and sharing of personally identifiable information (PII) prior to its 
collection; 
b. Provides appropriate means for individuals to understand the consequences of decisions to 
approve or decline the authorization of the collection, use, dissemination, and retention of PII; 
c. Obtains consent, where feasible and appropriate, from individuals prior to any new uses or 
disclosure of previously collected PII; and 
d. Ensures that individuals are aware of and, where feasible, consent to all uses of PII not 
initially described in the public notice that was in effect at the time the organization collected 
the PII. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Consent is fundamental to the participation of individuals in the decision-
making process regarding the collection and use of their PII and the use of technologies that may 
increase risk to personal privacy. To obtain consent, organizations provide individuals appropriate 
notice of the purposes of the PII collection or technology use and a means for individuals to 
consent to the activity. Organizations tailor the public notice and consent mechanisms to meet 
operational needs. Organizations achieve awareness and consent, for example, through updated 
public notices. 
Organizations may obtain consent through opt-in, opt-out, or implied consent. Opt-in consent is 
the preferred method, but it is not always feasible. Opt-in requires that individuals take affirmative 
action to allow organizations to collect or use PII. For example, opt-in consent may require an 
individual to click a radio button on a website, or sign a document providing consent. In contrast, 
opt-out requires individuals to take action to prevent the new or continued collection or use of 
such PII. For example, the Federal Trade Commission’s Do-Not-Call Registry allows individuals 
to opt-out of receiving unsolicited telemarketing calls by requesting to be added to a list. Implied 
consent is the least preferred method and should be used in limited circumstances. Implied consent 
occurs where individuals’ behavior or failure to object indicates agreement with the collection or 
use of PII (e.g., by entering and remaining in a building where notice has been posted that security 
cameras are in use, the individual implies consent to the video recording). Depending upon the 
nature of the program or information system, it may be appropriate to allow individuals to limit 
the types of PII they provide and subsequent uses of that PII. Organizational consent mechanisms 
include a discussion of the consequences to individuals of failure to provide PII. Consequences 
can vary from organization to organization. Related controls: AC-2, AP-1, TR-1, TR-2. 
Control Enhancements: 
(1) CONSENT | MECHANISMS SUPPORTING ITEMIZED OR TIERED CONSENT  
The organization implements mechanisms to support itemized or tiered consent for specific uses 
of data. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Organizations can provide, for example, individuals’ itemized choices 
as to whether they wish to be contacted for any of a variety of purposes. In this situation, 
organizations construct consent mechanisms to ensure that organizational operations comply 
with individual choices.

Act of 2002 (P.L. 107-347); OMB Memoranda 03-22, 10-22. 
IP-2 INDIVIDUAL ACCESS 
Control:  The organization:  
a. Provides individuals the ability to have access to their personally identifiable information 
(PII) maintained in its system(s) of records; 
b. Publishes rules and regulations governing how individuals may request access to records 
maintained in a Privacy Act system of records; 
c. Publishes access procedures in System of Records Notices (SORNs); and 
d. Adheres to Privacy Act requirements and OMB policies and guidance for the proper 
processing of Privacy Act requests. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Access affords individuals the ability to review PII about them held within 
organizational systems of records. Access includes timely, simplified, and inexpensive access to 
data. Organizational processes for allowing access to records may differ based on resources, legal 
requirements, or other factors. The organization Senior Agency Official for Privacy (SAOP)/Chief 
Privacy Officer (CPO) is responsible for the content of Privacy Act regulations and record request 
processing, in consultation with legal counsel. Access to certain types of records may not be 
appropriate, however, and heads of agencies may promulgate rules exempting particular systems 
from the access provision of the Privacy Act. In addition, individuals are not entitled to access to 
information compiled in reasonable anticipation of a civil action or proceeding. Related controls: 
AR-8, IP-3, TR-1, TR-2. 
Control Enhancements:  None.

Circular A-130. 
IP-3 REDRESS 
Control:  The organization:  
a. Provides a process for individuals to have inaccurate personally identifiable information (PII) 
maintained by the organization corrected or amended, as appropriate; and 
b. Establishes a process for disseminating corrections or amendments of the PII to other 
authorized users of the PII, such as external information-sharing partners and, where feasible 
and appropriate, notifies affected individuals that their information has been corrected or 
amended. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Redress supports the ability of individuals to ensure the accuracy of PII 
held by organizations. Effective redress processes demonstrate organizational commitment to data 
quality especially in those business functions where inaccurate data may result in inappropriate 
decisions or denial of benefits and services to individuals. Organizations use discretion in 
determining if records are to be corrected or amended, based on the scope of redress requests, the 
changes sought, and the impact of the changes. Individuals may appeal an adverse decision and 
have incorrect information amended, where appropriate. 
To provide effective redress, organizations: (i) provide effective notice of the existence of a PII 
collection; (ii) provide plain language explanations of the processes and mechanisms for 
requesting access to records; (iii) establish criteria for submitting requests for correction or 
amendment; (iv) implement resources to analyze and adjudicate requests; (v) implement means of 
correcting or amending data collections; and (vi) review any decisions that may have been the 
result of inaccurate information.

APPENDIX J   PAGE J-19 
Organizational redress processes provide responses to individuals of decisions to deny requests for 
correction or amendment, including the reasons for those decisions, a means to record individual 
objections to the organizational decisions, and a means of requesting organizational reviews of the 
initial determinations. Where PII is corrected or amended, organizations take steps to ensure that 
all authorized recipients of that PII are informed of the corrected or amended information. In 
instances where redress involves information obtained from other organizations, redress processes 
include coordination with organizations that originally collected the information. Related controls: 
IP-2, TR-1, TR-2, UL-2. 
Control Enhancements:  None. 
References:  The Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. § 552a (d), (c)(4); OMB Circular A-130. 
IP-4 COMPLAINT MANAGEMENT 
Control:  The organization implements a process for receiving and responding to complaints, 
concerns, or questions from individuals about the organizational privacy practices. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Complaints, concerns, and questions from individuals can serve as a 
valuable source of external input that ultimately improves operational models, uses of technology, 
data collection practices, and privacy and security safeguards. Organizations provide complaint 
mechanisms that are readily accessible by the public, include all information necessary for 
successfully filing complaints (including contact information for the Senior Agency Official for 
Privacy (SAOP)/Chief Privacy Officer (CPO) or other official designated to receive complaints), 
and are easy to use. Organizational complaint management processes include tracking mechanisms 
to ensure that all complaints received are reviewed and appropriately addressed in a timely 
manner. Related controls: AR-6, IP-3.

FAMILY:  SECURITY 
This family supplements the security controls in Appendix F to ensure that technical, physical, and 
administrative safeguards are in place to protect personally identifiable information (PII) collected or 
maintained by organizations against loss, unauthorized access, or disclosure, and to ensure that planning 
and responses to privacy incidents comply with OMB policies and guidance. The controls in this family 
are implemented in coordination with information security personnel and in accordance with the existing 
NIST Risk Management Framework. 
SE-1 INVENTORY OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION 
Control:  The organization:  
a. Establishes, maintains, and updates [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] an 
inventory that contains a listing of all programs and information systems identified as 
collecting, using, maintaining, or sharing personally identifiable information (PII); and 
b. Provides each update of the PII inventory to the CIO or information security official 
[Assignment: organization-defined frequency] to support the establishment of information 
security requirements for all new or modified information systems containing PII. 
Supplemental Guidance:  The PII inventory enables organizations to implement effective 
administrative, technical, and physical security policies and procedures to protect PII consistent 
with Appendix F, and to mitigate risks of PII exposure. As one method of gathering information 
for their PII inventories, organizations may extract the following information elements from 
Privacy Impact Assessments (PIA) for information systems containing PII: (i) the name and 
acronym for each system identified; (ii) the types of PII contained in that system; (iii) 
classification of level of sensitivity of all types of PII, as combined in that information system; and 
(iv) classification of level of potential risk of substantial harm, embarrassment, inconvenience, or 
unfairness to affected individuals, as well as the financial or reputational risks to organizations, if 
PII is exposed. Organizations take due care in updating the inventories by identifying linkable data 
that could create PII. Related controls: AR-1, AR-4, AR-5, AT-1, DM-1, PM-5, UL-3. 
Control Enhancements:  None.

Publication 199; NIST Special Publications 800-37, 800-122. 
SE-2 PRIVACY INCIDENT RESPONSE 
Control:  The organization:  
a. Develops and implements a Privacy Incident Response Plan; and 
b. Provides an organized and effective response to privacy incidents in accordance with the 
organizational Privacy Incident Response Plan.  
Supplemental Guidance:  In contrast to the Incident Response (IR) family in Appendix F, which 
concerns a broader range of incidents affecting information security, this control uses the term 
Privacy Incident to describe only those incidents that relate to personally identifiable information 
(PII). The organization Privacy Incident Response Plan is developed under the leadership of the 
SAOP/CPO. The plan includes: (i) the establishment of a cross-functional Privacy Incident 
Response Team that reviews, approves, and participates in the execution of the Privacy Incident 
Response Plan; (ii) a process to determine whether  notice to oversight organizations or affected 
individuals is appropriate and to provide that notice accordingly; (iii) a privacy risk assessment 
process to determine the extent of harm, embarrassment, inconvenience, or unfairness to affected 
individuals and, where appropriate, to take steps to mitigate any such risks; (iv) internal

procedures to ensure prompt reporting by employees and contractors of any privacy incident to 
information security officials and the Senior Agency Official for Privacy (SAOP)/Chief Privacy 
Officer (CPO), consistent with organizational incident management structures; and (v) internal 
procedures for reporting noncompliance with organizational privacy policy by employees or 
contractors to appropriate management or oversight officials. Some organizations may be required 
by law or policy to provide notice to oversight organizations in the event of a breach. 
Organizations may also choose to integrate Privacy Incident Response Plans with Security 
Incident Response Plans, or keep the plans separate. Related controls: AR-1, AR-4, AR-5, AR-6,

FAMILY:  TRANSPARENCY 
This family ensures that organizations provide public notice of their information practices and the 
privacy impact of their programs and activities. 
TR-1 PRIVACY NOTICE 
Control:  The organization:  
a. Provides effective notice to the public and to individuals regarding: (i) its activities that 
impact privacy, including its collection, use, sharing, safeguarding, maintenance, and disposal 
of personally identifiable information (PII); (ii) authority for collecting PII; (iii) the choices, if 
any, individuals may have regarding how the organization uses PII and the consequences of 
exercising or not exercising those choices; and (iv) the ability to access and have PII amended 
or corrected if necessary; 
b. Describes: (i) the PII the organization collects and the purpose(s) for which it collects that 
information; (ii) how the organization uses PII internally; (iii) whether the organization shares 
PII with external entities, the categories of those entities, and the purposes for such sharing; 
(iv) whether individuals have the ability to consent to specific uses or sharing of PII and how 
to exercise any such consent; (v) how individuals may obtain access to PII; and (vi) how the 
PII will be protected; and 
c. Revises its public notices to reflect changes in practice or policy that affect PII or changes in 
its activities that impact privacy, before or as soon as practicable after the change. 
Supplemental Guidance: Effective notice, by virtue of its clarity, readability, and comprehensiveness, 
enables individuals to understand how an organization uses PII generally and, where appropriate, 
to make an informed decision prior to providing PII to an organization. Effective notice also 
demonstrates the privacy considerations that the organization has addressed in implementing its 
information practices. The organization may provide general public notice through a variety of 
means, as required by law or policy, including System of Records Notices (SORNs), Privacy 
Impact Assessments (PIAs), or in a website privacy policy. As required by the Privacy Act, the 
organization also provides direct notice to individuals via Privacy Act Statements on the paper and 
electronic forms it uses to collect PII, or on separate forms that can be retained by the individuals. 
The organization Senior Agency Official for Privacy (SAOP)/Chief Privacy Officer (CPO) is 
responsible for the content of the organization’s public notices, in consultation with legal counsel 
and relevant program managers. The public notice requirement in this control is satisfied by an 
organization’s compliance with the public notice provisions of the Privacy Act, the E-Government 
Act’s PIA requirement, with OMB guidance related to federal agency privacy notices, and, where 
applicable, with policy pertaining to participation in the Information Sharing Environment 
(ISE).124 Changing PII practice or policy without prior notice is disfavored and should only be 
undertaken in consultation with the SAOP/CPO and counsel. Related controls: AP-1, AP-2, AR-1, 
AR-2, IP-1, IP-2, IP-3, UL-1, UL-2. 
Control Enhancements: 
(1) PRIVACY NOTICE | REAL-TIME OR LAYERED NOTICE  
The organization provides real-time and/or layered notice when it collects PII. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Real-time notice is defined as notice at the point of collection. A 
layered notice approach involves providing individuals with a summary of key points in the 
organization’s privacy policy. A second notice provides more detailed/specific information. 
                                                 
124 The Information Sharing Environment is an approach that facilitates the sharing of terrorism and homeland security 
information. The ISE was established by the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004, Public Law

TR-2 SYSTEM OF RECORDS NOTICES AND PRIVACY ACT STATEMENTS 
Control:  The organization:  
a. Publishes System of Records Notices (SORNs) in the Federal Register, subject to required 
oversight processes, for systems containing personally identifiable information (PII); 
b. Keeps SORNs current; and 
c. Includes Privacy Act Statements on its forms that collect PII, or on separate forms that can be 
retained by individuals, to provide additional formal notice to individuals from whom the 
information is being collected. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Organizations issue SORNs to provide the public notice regarding PII 
collected in a system of records, which the Privacy Act defines as “a group of any records under 
the control of any agency from which information is retrieved by the name of an individual or by 
some identifying number, symbol, or other identifier.” SORNs explain how the information is 
used, retained, and may be corrected, and whether certain portions of the system are subject to 
Privacy Act exemptions for law enforcement or national security reasons. Privacy Act Statements 
provide notice of: (i) the authority of organizations to collect PII; (ii) whether providing PII is 
mandatory or optional; (iii) the principal purpose(s) for which the PII is to be used; (iv) the 
intended disclosures (routine uses) of the information; and (v) the consequences of not providing 
all or some portion of the information requested. When information is collected verbally, 
organizations read a Privacy Act Statement prior to initiating the collection of PII (for example, 
when conducting telephone interviews or surveys). Related control: DI-2.

TR-3 DISSEMINATION OF PRIVACY PROGRAM INFORMATION 
Control:  The organization:  
a. Ensures that the public has access to information about its privacy activities and is able to 
communicate with its Senior Agency Official for Privacy (SAOP)/Chief Privacy Officer 
(CPO); and 
b. Ensures that its privacy practices are publicly available through organizational websites or 
otherwise. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Organizations employ different mechanisms for informing the public about 
their privacy practices including, but not limited to, Privacy Impact Assessments (PIAs), System 
of Records Notices (SORNs), privacy reports, publicly available web pages, email distributions, 
blogs, and periodic publications (e.g., quarterly newsletters). Organizations also employ publicly 
facing email addresses and/or phone lines that enable the public to provide feedback and/or direct 
questions to privacy offices regarding privacy practices. Related control: AR-6.

FAMILY:  USE LIMITATION 
This family ensures that organizations only use personally identifiable information (PII) either as 
specified in their public notices, in a manner compatible with those specified purposes, or as otherwise 
permitted by law. Implementation of the controls in this family will ensure that the scope of PII use is 
limited accordingly. 
UL-1 INTERNAL USE 
Control:  The organization uses personally identifiable information (PII) internally only for the 
authorized purpose(s) identified in the Privacy Act and/or in public notices. 
Supplemental Guidance:  Organizations take steps to ensure that they use PII only for legally 
authorized purposes and in a manner compatible with uses identified in the Privacy Act and/or in 
public notices. These steps include monitoring and auditing organizational use of PII and training 
organizational personnel on the authorized uses of PII. With guidance from the Senior Agency 
Official for Privacy (SAOP)/Chief Privacy Officer (CPO) and where appropriate, legal counsel, 
organizations document processes and procedures for evaluating any proposed new uses of PII to 
assess whether they fall within the scope of the organizational authorities. Where appropriate, 
organizations obtain consent from individuals for the new use(s) of PII. Related controls: AP-2, 
AR-2, AR-3, AR-4, AR-5, IP-1, TR-1, TR-2.

UL-2 INFORMATION SHARING WITH THIRD PARTIES 
Control:  The organization:  
a. Shares personally identifiable information (PII) externally, only for the authorized purposes 
identified in the Privacy Act and/or described in its notice(s) or for a purpose that is 
compatible with those purposes; 
b. Where appropriate, enters into Memoranda of Understanding, Memoranda of Agreement, 
Letters of Intent, Computer Matching Agreements, or similar agreements, with third parties 
that specifically describe the PII covered and specifically enumerate the purposes for which 
the PII may be used; 
c. Monitors, audits, and trains its staff on the authorized sharing of PII with third parties and on 
the consequences of unauthorized use or sharing of PII; and 
d. Evaluates any proposed new instances of sharing PII with third parties to assess whether the 
sharing is authorized and whether additional or new public notice is required. 
Supplemental Guidance:  The organization Senior Agency Official for Privacy (SAOP)/Chief 
Privacy Officer (CPO) and, where appropriate, legal counsel review and approve any proposed 
external sharing of PII, including with other public, international, or private sector entities, for 
consistency with uses described in the existing organizational public notice(s). When a proposed 
new instance of external sharing of PII is not currently authorized by the Privacy Act and/or 
specified in a notice, organizations evaluate whether the proposed external sharing is compatible 
with the purpose(s) specified in the notice. If the proposed sharing is compatible, organizations 
review, update, and republish their Privacy Impact Assessments (PIAs), System of Records 
Notices (SORNs), website privacy policies, and other public notices, if any, to include specific 
descriptions of the new uses(s) and obtain consent where appropriate and feasible. Information-
sharing agreements also include security protections consistent with the sensitivity of the 
information being shared. Related controls: AR-3, AR-4, AR-5, AR-8, AP-2, DI-1, DI-2, IP-1, 
TR-1.
