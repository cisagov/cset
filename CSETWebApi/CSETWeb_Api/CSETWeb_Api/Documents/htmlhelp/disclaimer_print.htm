The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) does not provide any warranties of any kind regarding any information contained within. In no event shall the United States Government or its contractors or subcontractors be liable for any damages, including but not limited to, direct, indirect, special, or consequential damages and including damages based on any negligence of the United States Government or its contractors or subcontractors, arising out of, resulting from, or in any way connected with this report, whether based on warranty, contract, tort, or otherwise, whether injury was sustained from, or arose out of the results of, or reliance upon the report.&quot;</div>

Use of the DHS seal without proper authorization violates federal law (e.g., 18 U.S.C. §§ 506, 701, 1017) and is against DHS policies governing usage of the seal.&quot;</div>
