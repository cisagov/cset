Loss in public confidence is a further potential consequence. Additionally, some information associated with air transportation functions is proprietary to corporations or subject to privacy laws. In such cases, the confidentiality impact resulting from unauthorized disclosure can be moderate. The sensitivity of air transportation information (e.g., aircraft positioning data)can be time or event-driven. For example, passenger lists are not releasable to the general public before a flight takes off, but are placed in the public domain in the event of a crash. In such cases, the confidentiality impact resulting from unauthorized disclosure can be moderate.', N'LOW', N'Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: Some air transportation functions are time-critical (e.g., air traffic control instructions, position reports, situational awareness, separation, weather reports for the terminal area, microburst tracking, maintenance trouble reports). Communications management (e.g., frequency management) information also needs to be included in air transportation integrity impact considerations. There may be circumstances under which erroneous frequency assignment information can result in a loss of communications with aircraft that are affected by hazardous conditions (e.g., loss of communications with an aircraft in a crowded air space.) Unauthorized modification or destruction of time-critical information necessary to these functions can result in large-scale property loss and in loss of human lives. The Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) supplements the availability and integrity of position information available from the DoD''s Global Positioning Systems (GPS). Because of the potential system-wide impacts from a loss of integrity of this system, a high integrity impact level is recommended.', N'LOW', N'Special Factors Affecting Availability Impact Determination: Some air transportation functions are time-critical (e.g., air traffic control instructions, position reports, situational awareness, separation, weather reports for the terminal area, microburst tracking, maintenance trouble reports). Loss of availability of time-critical information necessary to these functions can result in large-scale property loss and in loss of human lives. Timing plays a large part in the availability impact of air transportation information. For example, the time criticality of weather information may be measured in minutes or hours in the case of pre-flight and mid-flight operations. However, on final landing approach, up to the second availability may be required (e.g., detection of microbursts in the terminal area). Air operations are not tolerant of information loss. The Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) supplements the availability of information available from the Department of Defense''s Global Positioning Systems (GPS). Because of the potential system-wide impacts from a loss of availability of this system, it would be appropriately categorized as having a high availability impact.', N'Operations', N'D.11.3')
